	First, connect up each of the yellow wires. In the image of the R-UST above, you will see red wires connecting the yellow wires from the PACMAN-generator to the SMES, and from the SMES to the fusion core. These are the wires you need to add.<br>
	The fusion core and gyrotron have a heavy power drain when operational. You will need to use the PACMAN to provide this until the fusion process becomes self-sustaining. Insert some tritium ingots from the radioactive crate and turn on the PACMAN with between 0.1MW and 0.15MW of power.<br>
	Create five deuterium and one tritium fuel rod using the fuel compressor and insert these into the fuel injectors, one per injector.<br>
	Return to the control room and raise the chamber containment shutters and ensure that the chamber observation is only down if you are wearing radiation protection gear.<br>
	Set the gyrotron to fire delay 2, power 50. There can be an initial burst in instability when turning the reactor on - If you have allowed fuel to build up. So we set the gyrotron to a high-power mode for the initial startup. Do not walk infront of the gyrotron while it is active.<br>
	Turn on the fusion core and adjust the field strength to 20 tesla.<br>
	Turn on all the fusion fuel injectors.<br>
	Watch the temperature and power rise on the fusion core console. Make sure that the instability is being managed by the gyrotron (less than 1%).<br>
	Once the power output is 250kW or higher, return to the R-UST room and turn off the PACMAN-generator. It may explode if you leave it running for too long.<br>
	You can now adjust the gyrotron power to a lower setting, such as fire delay 3, power output 3. Check that the instability is staying low after adjusting the gyrotron.

	<hr>
	<center><b>CHAIN OF PERMISSION</b><br></center>
	<li>If the Research Director is not available, consult to the Site Director.<br>
	<li>If the Site Director is not available, consult to the Guard Commander.<br>
	<li>If the Guard Commander is not available, all testing is to be halted until further notice, or awakening of one of these three heads of staff.<br>
	<li>Keter testing is to be halted until both the Site Director, and Research Director are available.<br>
	<li>O5 Command is a available option in the case of requiring dire permission to test if none of these three heads of staff are available.<br>
	<hr>
	<b>STEP ONE: Check what the current site-wise security level is:</b><br>
	<ul><li>CODE GREEN: Testing is to be conducted as normal.<br>
	<li>CODE YELLOW: Testing can be refused by the checkpoint officer if there is an imminent threat to staff within the respective zone of the checkpoint. <br>
	<li>CODE ORANGE and RED: No tests are to be conducted. Currently active tests may be ended at the discretion of the Zone Sergeants and above.<br>
	<li>CODE BLACK and PITCHBLACK: No tests are to be conducted. All currently active tests are to be ended as soon as possible.</ul>
	<b>STEP TWO:</b> Check the legitimacy of given paperwork. If the documentation is inconclusive or forged, detain all involved personnel and report to your Zone Sergeants.<br>
	Paperwork must clearly state the SCP's and materials involved in the test. If it does not, directly contact the Reaserch Director and do not allow entry.<br>
	You do not have the right to either authorize or deny a test. Senior Researcher staff may test on Safe level SCPs at their discretion and do not need explicit approval, however, do still need paperwork. Euclid-Class SCPs require a signature, and stamp from the Research Director. Keter-Class SCPs require both Research Director and Site Director signatures, and stamps. Cross tests require both Research Director and Site Director signatures, and stamps along with O5 Command Approval. You may, however, deny a test depending on the site's security level, if the test is unethical, and or against regulations, or if the individuals are suspicious. <br>
	If a test conflicts with the SCP's containment procedures, you are to notify the Research Director and Site Director. If both are unavailable, deny the test. If the Research Director and Site Director still approve the test, you may allow entry. Otherwise, the research team shall be denied entry until sufficient changes are made. After all checks are made, you may stamp their document with a stamp to confirm their pass through the checkpoint.<br>
	<b>STEP THREE:</b> Notify the Site Director and the Research Director through email of any attempts to pass through checkpoints for research. State the test and target SCP and whether or not they have been cleared to enter by checkpoint personnel. If you denied their entry, state the reason as to why in your email.<br>
	If all paperwork is acceptable and no objections have been raised by either the Research Director or Site Director, you may allow the personnel to pass the checkpoint.<br>
	<b>STEP FOUR:</b> If the test is on a Euclid level SCP or higher, or the Researcher has a Class-D present with them, they are to be acompanied by Zone Security, one officer is for every two D-Class. Said Zone Officer is to guard the chamber as the test is conducted. However, if the manpower does not meet standards, the test shall be denied until further notice.<br>
	When returning, all personnel must be frisked again before transferring through the checkpoint, this counts for backpacks, labcoats, and as well as webbing, boots, and pockets.

<br>
Congratulations, you're in charge of assignments today!
<br>
<b>Before assigning work detail to anyone, make sure to coordinate with your fellow cell guards and Lieutenant to see if all work places have at least one cell guard overlooking it!</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>As an additional note, there is a maximum of work assignments, which is 6x mining and manual labor, 4 x botany, 3x kitchen, 4x janitorial and 6x mining, making for 17 work places at current time.</b>
<br>
<b>DO NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED OF WORKSPACES UNDER THREAT OF IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Cell guards must not assign access other than the D-Class Work Zones. Doing this will result in immediate employment termination.</b>
<br>
Steps to assign someone to work duty;
<br>
0. Remind all guards that work duty assignment requires them to update their access as well. Ask the Lieutenant to hand out assignments ASAP. Guard assignments go first. D-Cells may be unlocked after.
<br>
1. D-Class are allowed to cite their preference. This does not mean you have to grant them at you.
<br>
2. Ask for the ID Card of the D-Class, and assign the appropriate access. Only one work assignment per D-Class.
<br>
3. Return ID Card to D-Class, and give them instructions on how to get to their area.
<br>
4. Inform guards at work stations of the D-Number that is coming their way, so they do not let in random people.
<br>
<br>
<b>Once you are done with assigning D-Class, or the work assignments are full, close down the shutters and secure the Mastercard in the locker supplied next to your desk. The safe code is 15954. Failure to do this will result in immediate termination.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Assigning additional access to yourself besides the Class D work assignments is noted, and logged in the secure logging system of this terminal. Termination will be instant.</b>
<br>
<br>
Good luck on your shift! For further questions, please defer to your Cell Lieutenant. Return this piece of paper to the Guard Lieutenant, or stash it in the safe if one is not around.
