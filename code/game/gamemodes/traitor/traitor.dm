		Are you in the safe self-contained workplace you once thought it was, or has it become a playground \
		for the evils of the world? Who can you trust? Watch your front. Watch your sides. Watch your back. \
		The familiar faces that you've passed hundreds of times down the hallways before can be hiding terrible \
		secrets and deceptions. Every corner is a mystery. Every conversation is a lie. You will be facing your \
		friends and family as they try to use your emotions and trust to their advantage, leaving you with nothing \
		but the painful reminder that space is cruel and unforgiving."
