	<br><br>Switch to Grab intent to scoop up items by hitting them, or add them to the tray directly. Hit a table with Grab intent active to unload the tray's contents onto it. \
	You can also activate the tray in-hand to dump its contents onto whatever's beneath you.\
	<br><br>Non-Grab intents can be used to put the tray down onto surfaces without dumping it out, or Harm intent can be used to hit people with the tray itself. \
	If you're a cyborg, robot, or other non-human, Help intent replaces Grab intent for interactions that use it. \
	<br><br>Baking sheets are a larger version of trays that have special interactions with cooking stoves. Using the sheet on the stove will put it inside, \
	and when cooking, each sheet in the stove will cook its ingredients independently. This lets you cook multiple things at the same time, even if they're different dishes."

	mechanics_text = "The electric stove - or its smaller cousin, the hot plate - is the primary cooking tool you have at your disposal. \
	Cooking food is done by adding ingredients to the stove in the right amounts, then activating it. \
	<br><br>When adding ingredients to the stove, make sure you have exactly the right ratio; having the wrong ingredients is a \
	great way to burn your food! \
	<br><br>Baking sheets have special behavior when added to a stove. They're treated as their own container for ingredients; as such, you can \
	cook separate dishes at the same time by putting their ingredients onto different sheets and putting them all into the stove. Baking sheets won't \
	affect the outcome of food cooked directly in the stove, either, so if you have a complex recipe that you can't fit on a sheet, you can put it \
	straight into the stove while also cooking a different recipe on the sheet, too."

	mechanics_text = "Microwaves are used to cook simple food in bulk. There exist several foods that are primarily used in making other foods; \
	dough, cheese wedges, cutlets, eggs, and so on. Microwaves simply heat all the ingredients inside them, which may turn them into other things. \
	As such, it doesn't generally make dishes itself, but it's vital for speedy cooking. \
	<br><br>Unlike a stove, food in a microwave will never be turned into a burned mess if it isn't properly handled. Instead, it simply won't change at all. \
	<br><br>If your cooking skill is at least Trained, you can examine some foods to see what they turn into when they're microwaved. This is restricted to \
	foods that significantly change when microwaved - raw cutlets, dough, and so on."
