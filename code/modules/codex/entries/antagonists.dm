	lore_text = "Changelings are intelligent anomalous creatures with a unique biology that allows them to morph into most organic lifeforms. \
	They are rare solitary hunters, and have existed for an unknown length of time among the galaxy's civilized races.<br>\
	They are, ultimately, creatures of stealth - hiding behind the faces of their victims, lurking in distant backwaters and humongous cities, \
	waiting for their chance to strike."
	antag_text = "As a changeling, you have almost certainly killed a staff member and replaced them in order to conceal yourself aboard the site. \
	You've had time to familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of their identity.<br>\
	General knowledge of changelings is nearly nonexistent. No public government or institution has any knowledge about changelings' existence, \
	and the number of changelings in human space, impersonating humans themselves, is unknown, although estimated by the Foundation to be low. \
	This gives you a lot of leniency in determining where you came from and why you're aboard the site, so don't be afraid to get creative.<br>\
	When a changeling consumes a victim, it does so by using a proboscis to 'absorb' them, draining their body of fluids and leaving behind a shriveled, mummified husk. \
	In doing so, the changeling is able to assimilate their victim's thoughts, recent memories, and more importantly, their entire genetic sequence. \
	When it transforms, a changeling literally becomes the person it's imitating - down to their very DNA.<br\
	Your true personality, whatever it may be, is likely alien to humans, unless you are very charismatic in presenting it. \
	Composed of the memories and identities of multiple individuals, you are a collective mind, and as such, \
	you use plural pronouns during internal monologue ('we', 'ours', and so on.).<br>\
	The way you value other sapient life may range from curiosity to simply viewing them as prey. \
	At the least, you likely see them as very primitive, like a spacefaring civilization might see a tribe. \
	If you strive to protect sapient life, it is very unlikely to be out of genuine goodwill as much as it is wanting to keep livestock alive to cull them later.<br>\
	Changelings are solitary. They are naturally suspicious of one another, and often reluctant to cooperate or even communicate - \
	they are fully capable of absorbing one another, and when they do so, they reap far more benefit than consuming normal people. \
	Changelings in a local area may deign to communicate through one another through local airwaves if they choose to, \
	but every friend is a potential foe; every alliance is a double-cross waiting to happen. In the presence of one another, changelings never let their guard down.<br>\
	When you transform into a member of a different species, you maintain your own mindset and thoughts. \
	You don't adapt the personality of whoever it was that you're imitating (even if it may influence your behaviour), \
	and you aren't beholden to any of the trappings of the way their brains work. Impersonation comes naturally to you as a changeling, \
	and you are experienced with adopting and shedding bodies and personalities on a whim as it suits your needs."
