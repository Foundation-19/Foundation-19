	If the heat reaches above 7000 kelvin, it will send an alert and start taking damage.<br>\
	After integrity falls to zero percent, it will delaminate, causing a massive explosion, site-wide radiation spikes, and hallucinations.<br>\
	Supermatter reacts badly to oxygen in the atmosphere.  It'll also heat up really quick if it is in vacuum.<br>\
	<br>\
	Supermatter cores are extremely dangerous to be close to, and requires protection to handle properly.  The protection you will need is:<br>\
	Optical meson scanners on your eyes, to prevent hallucinations when looking at the supermatter.<br>\
	Radiation helmet and suit, as the supermatter is radioactive.<br>\
	<br>\
	Touching the supermatter will result in *instant death*, with no corpse left behind!  You can drag the supermatter, but anything else will kill you."

	Power consumption and backup power cell charge can be seen from the interface, further controls (turning a specific channel on, off or automatic, toggling the APC's ability to charge the backup cell, or toggling power for the entire area via master breaker) first requires the interface to be unlocked with an ID with Engineering access or by one of the station's robots or the artificial intelligence.<br>\
	APCs, if <span codexlink='cryptographic sequencer'>emagged</span>, will be permanently unlocked, with a visible blue error screen.<br>\
	<span codexlink='Hacking wires'>Wire hacking</span> can be useful when dealing with APCs.<br>\
