	They hold a wide array of tools to build, repair, maintain, and clean.<br>\
	Drones function similarly to other synthetics, in that they require recharging regularly, have laws, and are resilient to many hazards, such as fire, radiation, vacuum, and more.<br>\
	Ghosts can join the round as a maintenance drone by using the appropriate verb in the 'ghost' tab.<br>\
	An inactive drone can be rebooted by swiping an ID card on it with engineering or robotics access, and an active drone can be shut down in the same manner.<br>\
	Maintenance drone presence can be requested to specific areas from any maintenance drone control console.<br>\
	If a <l>cryptographic sequencer</l> is used on a drone, it will be reprogrammed and show full allegience to the subverter."
