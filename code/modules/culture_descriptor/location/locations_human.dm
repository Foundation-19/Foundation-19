	description = "Earth, home of humankind, has long been in a state of recovery following centuries of pollution and exploitation. Today, much of \
	the Earth exists as a nature reserve, dedicated to preserving the history of humanity. The humans that remain live mostly in large urban zones \
	across the globe. Huge, planned cities consisting of numerous arcologies with a focus on eco-friendliness. No longer the political power of \
	Humanity, Earth is content to be something of a backwater and tourist destination for those looking to discover their heritage.<br><br>People from \
	Earth are among the wealthier humans on average, though they are still comparable with those of Mars. Remarkably average, the people of Earth are \
	much as they have been for hundreds of years, and are generally content with their lot in life. From a variety of ancient cultures, the people of \
	Earth are as diverse as they have always been."
