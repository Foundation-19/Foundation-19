 * Template reagent used for toxins, poisons, venoms, and so on.
 * This particular subtype deals toxin damage to the body's organs.
 * Many "toxic" reagents don't actually deal straight toxin damage, so only the minority of reagents actually use this subtype.

 * Of note: Unlike `/datum/reagent/medicine`, this type is not just for inheritance, and it can be found in a few different places.

	Because of the wide range of awful things reagents can do to you, "toxin" is just a blanket term for reagents that are generally harmful.
	As a result, we have a lot of subfiles under this folder, only a few of which contain the kinds of poisons that kill you dead.
	Further reagent types are sorted into subfiles in this folder.

	toxins_acids.dm - Corrosive liquids that cause heavy burn damage and melt objects.
	toxins_botany.dm - Reagents used in plant care that also happen to be toxic.
	toxins_drugs.dm - Drugs that are either negative to health or would, in-character, impair function.
	toxins_misc.dm - Things that are toxic, but don't fit anywhere else.
	toxins_mutagens.dm - Chemicals that cause physical mutations in their victims.
	toxins_narcotics.dm - Reagents that affect movement or the brain.
	toxins_poisons.dm - Horrible things that cause other horrible things to happen.
	toxins_sedatives.dm - Chemicals that are primarily used to incapacitate or put people to sleep.
