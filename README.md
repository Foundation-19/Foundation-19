Discord is the place where most of the discussion happens, due to absence of a forum. Here you can contact administrators, ask mentors for help, or simply discuss your rounds. It is also a place where you can find links to ban appeals, admin applications and others, which could be really useful.

**Space Station 13** is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. This is an SCP inspired flavour, set on **Site 53**.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then set up the server normally by opening `baystation12.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building baystation12.dmb in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
