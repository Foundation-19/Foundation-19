changes:
  - rscadd: Guard clothing now protects slightly more against acid attacks. The combat
      bio hood protects EXTREMELY well against acid attacks.
  - balance: If acid is fully blocked by clothing, it does no damage.
  - bugfix: Bug where acid (and other reagents with high touch_metabolisms) was treated
      as volume 50 for damage has been fixed.
