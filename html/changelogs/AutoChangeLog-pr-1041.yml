changes:
  - bugfix: SCP-106 code has been reworked, all of it. This probably does not concern
      normal players, though.
  - tweak: SCP-106 has been given more visual and audio effects to its abilities.
  - tweak: Femur breaker is now more "interesting" when used. Shove your friend in
      there, NOW!
