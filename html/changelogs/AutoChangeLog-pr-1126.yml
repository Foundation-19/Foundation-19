changes:
  - rscadd: Made the MTF Alpha 1 Red Right Hand beret actually armoured (on the same
      level as their armour). No more quick death for the elites of Alpha One
  - rscadd: the LCZ Armoury has the very inefficient "riot shotguns" replaced with
      Saiga 12 (There are 10 in total, plus the one in the ZC locker, totalling 11
      for all 11 LCZ slots). They only start with beanbag mags and boxes, to get lethal
      buckshot or other specialized shells they'd need ZC approval to open the armoury
  - rscadd: Gave P90 it's full auto settign back
  - rscadd: Divided LCZ armoury into a lethal area and a non lethal area compartment,
      both compartment can be opened or locked by the ZC.
