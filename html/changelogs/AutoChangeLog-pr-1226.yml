changes:
  - rscadd: Ports TG alerts system. Alerts are the notifications that show up on the
      top-right when you're e.g. hot, hungry, a robot with a low power cell, etc.
  - rscadd: Ports TG traits. Traits are a backend system that allows things to track
      what exactly is making you blind/clumsy/whatever.
  - rscadd: Ports TG status effects. Status effects are things like being stunned,
      blinded, or having a speech impediment. We have these things, but they don't
      work very well at all (compared to how TG does em).
  - rscadd: Ports TG movespeed modifiers. Movespeed modifiers allow code to cleanly
      adjust movement speed.
  - rscdel: Removes old shitcode that was phased out with all the TG ports.
  - imageadd: Adds icons related to the new alerts system.
