changes:
  - rscadd: Moved the auxiliary nuclear reactors in Engineering down to a separate
      sub-room, away from the SMESs.
  - balance: Engineering SMESs no longer start with insane levels of power. Get that
      reactor working!
  - balance: The R-UST has an extra SMES.
  - balance: The R-UST produces 2.5x more power
  - balance: 'Boron is now fully implemented and can be bought from cargo (hint hint:
      you need it for high-tier R-UST reactions)'
  - bugfix: Battery racks now hold 9 cells (as their sprite implies).
  - balance: The crates near the battery racks in Engineering have 9 high-capacity
      cells for each instead of 6 super-capacity cells.
  - balance: Upgrading SMESs no longer has a chance to blow up.
