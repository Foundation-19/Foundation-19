  - rscadd: A computer needs to have internet access for AI to interact with it.
  - rscdel: Docking management programs deleted.

      checkpoint , its slightly more secure now with an airlock style blast gate system.
      Still has the delivery chute and pen for the animals.

  EgorDinamit:
  - tweak: Beam tasers were replaced with the ones firing electrode projectiles. Those
      don't pass through windows/airlocks.

      allow for their use for non-lethal takedowns.
  - tweak: P90 firing sound replaced.
  - tweak: Guard lockers had their contents updated and standardized.

      into CDCZ, allowing proper checkpoint rp
  - rscadd: Maintenance tunnel from Archive to HCZ has been made impassable to make
      HCZ a truly secure unit (Most SCPs are able to steamroll their way through the
      checkpoint regardless, but now during a breach, security actually has a better
      chance at containing the beasts)
  Tsurupeta:
  - soundadd: updated fire sound for MK9 pistol
  - imageadd: updated icon for MK9 pistol
  - bugfix: Fixed movement keys not working on roundstart. Again.
