  - rscadd: 999 can understand english (and all other languages)! It can also respond
      (if you count "glub" as a response).
  - rscdel: 999 no longer "attaches" to people. Instead, interaction is performed
      simply by clicking. Help intent lets you give someone a hug, hurt intent gives
      tickle attacks, and disarm trips.
  - balance: 999 improves sanity instead of healing. Also happens more often. Works
      via reagent, so effect lasts for a little after use.
  - refactor: 999 interaction code COMPLETELY overhauled.
  - balance: 999 force-moving someone is a do_after instead of a random chance per
      button press.
  - bugfix: 999 timer bug fixed.
