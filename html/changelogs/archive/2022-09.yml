  MACIEKBAKI:
  - rscadd: Improved SCP-096 targetting; targets closer will be murdered first
  - rscadd: SCP-096 will now use previously-unused icons when idle and when screaming.
  - rscdel: SCP-096 no longer plays scare sounds akin to being jumpscared by SCP-173
      in containment breach
  - bugfix: SCP-096 will no longer follow you around in its idle state.
  - code_imp: 'made SCP-096 code slightly better: now only one variable tracks his
      state (instead of four). Also cleaned up some bad code and straight up yeeted
      a commented-out proc (which we dont have in our codebase, even)'
