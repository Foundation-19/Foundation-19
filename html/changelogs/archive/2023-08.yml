  - rscadd: Adds new contraband detectors! Found in LCZ D-block next to mining, and
      constructable by engineers, these scanners search personnel that walk through
      it for contraband (guns, tools, knives, etc). There are also ways for clever
      D-class to bypass or even abuse them -- check the codex entry for more information.

  - rscadd: You may now become addicted to certain drugs if you've been taking them
      for long enough. Becoming addicted is done by gaining addiction points from
      doing drugs in a specific category; If you become addicted, you can stop being
      addicted by lowering your addiction points until it reaches a low enough value(i.e.
      by not taking drugs). Most addictions will have withdraval effects, however.
