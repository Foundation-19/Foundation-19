  - rscadd: Adds new contraband detectors! Found in LCZ D-block next to mining, and
      constructable by engineers, these scanners search personnel that walk through
      it for contraband (guns, tools, knives, etc). There are also ways for clever
      D-class to bypass or even abuse them -- check the codex entry for more information.
