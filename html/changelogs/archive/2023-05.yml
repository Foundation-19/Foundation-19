  - tweak: SCP 173's auto-breach effect is now instant, instead of one blastdoor at
      a time.
  TheDarkElites:
  - rscadd: 173 AI now good :)
  - balance: 173 is now active in low-pop but AI only and cannot self-breach.
  checkraisefold:
  - bugfix: Fixed moderator skill panel access.
  cheesePizza2:
  - rscadd: Trying to use a chem dispenser with the lowest skill level gives you a
      chance of mis-inputting and getting a completely different chemical.
  - balance: Polytrinic acid damage lowered.
  - balance: BODA dispenser was changed to a Water Dispenser, which does NOT dispense
      glass.

  - balance: The Class-D seed servitor charges money.
  - balance: Disarming has been changed to be less buggy, less random, and less OP.

  cheesePizza2:
  - rscadd: Guard clothing now protects slightly more against acid attacks. The combat
      bio hood protects EXTREMELY well against acid attacks.
  - balance: If acid is fully blocked by clothing, it does no damage.
  - bugfix: Bug where acid (and other reagents with high touch_metabolisms) was treated
      as volume 50 for damage has been fixed.
  - bugfix: SCPs breaking machinery is slightly improved.

  GGarciaECE:
  - rscadd: Made the MTF Alpha 1 Red Right Hand beret actually armoured (on the same
      level as their armour). No more quick death for the elites of Alpha One
  - rscadd: the LCZ Armoury has the very inefficient "riot shotguns" replaced with
      Saiga 12 (There are 10 in total, plus the one in the ZC locker, totalling 11
      for all 11 LCZ slots). They only start with beanbag mags and boxes, to get lethal
      buckshot or other specialized shells they'd need ZC approval to open the armoury
  - rscadd: Gave P90 it's full auto settign back
  - rscadd: Divided LCZ armoury into a lethal area and a non lethal area compartment,
      both compartment can be opened or locked by the ZC.
