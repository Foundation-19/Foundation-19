2019-01-02:
  afterthought2:
  - tweak: The colony will no longer start irradiated.
2019-01-03:
  Broseph Stylin:
  - rscadd: A system to automatically switch clothing icons based on gender has been
      introduced. It is currently set up to work for humans and human subspecies.
  - tweak: Expeditionary Corps, Fleet and Army uniforms as well as EXO and corporate
      variations of the Torch Research uniforms now have gendered icons.
2019-01-06:
  Cakey:
  - maptweak: Fixed odd spacing in supply, adds a cargo lift to the warehouse.
  CrimsonShrike:
  - rscadd: Adds detective instinct verb for master forensics. This will give most
      of the scene a distinctive noir look.
  Hubblenaut:
  - bugfix: Fixes shuttles removing air from the hangar upon arrival.
2019-01-07:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: Radiation resistance now fully blocks radiation levels below its radiation
      resistance percentage, and thereafter will only allow some radiation leakthrough.
      Lower resistance suits leak much more readily once  past the threshold, while
      high resistance suits will only leak a little bit after the threshold is reached.
      Very highly irradiated environments are still extremely dangerous.
2019-01-08:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: The CE Firesuit is now firefighting rated, just like firesuits and atmos
      suits.
  Chinsky:
  - soundadd: Pain has a low chance of heartstop again. High shock levels ('You feel
      like you can die any moment now!' level) can sometimes cause thready pulse.
      Countered by giving poor sod some painkillers to prevent shock, or some inapro
      to stabilize the pulse.
  sabiram:
  - maptweak: The Christmas tree in the bar has been removed.
2019-01-10:
  Anticept:
  - rscadd: Added a waste tank for atmospheric waste gasses next to the fuel bay.
      Now there's a place for gasses the Torch doesn't have a tank for, as well as
      storage for engine byproducts, and can be dumped to space or recovered with
      canisters. Also acts like a good way to clear a backed up atmos system if you
      know how to configure the pumps and valves, and don't mind spacing the gas.
  - rscdel: Engineering thrusters (not nacelles) are now purged from the game. They
      offered next to no thrust at all and now the engine room is a little bit simpler.
  - tweak: All black pipes in engineering ultimately go to the waste tank.
  - tweak: Removed redundant fuel bay firedoor (it had two at the entrance).

      and moves nt logo to [ntlogo]
  comma:
  - tweak: All speed/acceleration values are now displayed multiplied by 1000. Actual
      mechanics are still same.
  - tweak: Only 1 random alien seed in Xenoflora storage now, and can't order them
      from cargo. Go on expeditions nerds.
  - maptweak: No more pre-spawned anomalies on Petrov. Go on expeditions nerds.
  lorwp:
  - tweak: IPCs can now use the Command Hardsuits
2019-01-11:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: Radiation planets background rads peak out at 75bq. Hotspots are still
      deadly though!
  - tweak: Adjusted waste tank dump port so it goes to the edge of shields, rather
      than dumping onto the top of D3 pod.
  - tweak: Added a pump to the waste tank canister port.
  BlueNexus:
  - maptweak: Nacelles have been reworked.
  - bugfix: As a result, combustion mode works again.
  MistakeNot4892:
  - rscdel: Removed the education system entirely.

      something else in your global preferences to start getting them on join.
  - tweak: Merged ambitions into goals.
2019-01-13:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: The "Set transfer amount" verb's range is now one tile, so now you don't
      have to be carrying them to set it anymore.
  - bugfix: ghosts and unconscious can no longer invoke the set transfer amount verb
      on containers and IVs.
  - tweak: Gas sensors in atmos and waste tank now display all gas contents that they
      can identify.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Falling down zlevels now has a chance to dislocate feet/arms. Athletic
      skill mitigates it, Trained and above are safe.
  - tweak: Setting dislocated limbs now requires Medicine skill to be reliable, especially
      for self-setting. Basic skill is enough for ~90% success rate, Trained is guaranteed
      or your money back.
  - tweak: Walking on fractured or dislocated limbs now applies additional pain to
      that limb. Rest a bit for it to clear up or use a cane.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Large escape pods will now repressurize themselves after undocking.
2019-01-21:
  Anticept:
  - rscadd: CMOs rejoice! Your hypospray now has a quantity setting, you can administer
      in 1,2,5,10,15,20, or 30 units per injection!
  - rscadd: CMOs rejoice! You can now pour your hypospray contents into a container
      without removing the vial! (you can already put reagents in it too without swapping
      vials)
  - rscadd: CMOs rejoice! You are now coordinated enough to swap vials on the fly.
      No longer do you have to remove and put away the old vial before you can install
      a new one.
  - rscadd: Medical rejoice! The contractor producing your syringes have heard your
      cries and installed easier to read graduations on syringes. You now can set
      transfer amounts in 1, 2, and 5.
  - rscadd: Everyone rejoice! When pouring containers, you will now be able to see
      how many units are remaining.
  - bugfix: drones and borgs can once again use r-glass.
  - bugfix: drones and borgs glass stacks are colored correctly.
  Blue Bit:
  - rscadd: Security borgs now have a hailer.
  - bugfix: The playable colony should once again have its rods.
  Cakey:
  - maptweak: The robotics lab is now two-floored. Has a lift.
  - maptweak: Cyborg station has been moved next to atmospherics.
  ChaosAlpha:
  - bugfix: Robots and drones should once again be able to drop items from their grippers
      from the Silicon Commands tab (the verb has been renamed "Drop Gripped Item").
  - bugfix: Robots and drones now drop all gripped items on death.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Rods are now material based, can be made from more than just steel. Same
      with grilles and lattices.
  - rscadd: Windows are material based too, any non-opaque material can be used to
      make them (currently diamonds and quartz).
  - rscadd: You can get back rods from rglass (rphoronglass) by welding them out.
  - bugfix: Autolathe now will properly get some steel material on top of glass if
      you feed it rglass.
  Eckff:
  - tweak: The sleep button now keeps you asleep until you press it again. It will
      not wake you up from other things that cause you to sleep, like chems.
  Eckles:
  - bugfix: Fixes sprite and object issues with the riot security voidsuit for Unathi
      and Skrell
  Hubblenaut:
  - bugfix: Fixes cameras of robots, hardsuits, Thunderdome and similar not being
      accessable.
  MistakeNot4892:
  - tweak: Locker icons now use a runtime-based system. This should have no player-facing
      impact other than the cosmetic effects of new locker icons.
  - rscadd: Added a Loss Prevention Associate role. Basically a bodyguard for the
      Workplace Liaison. They can only spawn with an active Liaison in the round,
      and get a secure gun with corporate access.
  - tweak: Added backend support for deferred roles, please make a bug if this breaks
      anything in roundstart job allocation.
  - rscadd: Added a stomach organ. If your stomach is damaged, you can't eat properly
      and won't metabolize reagents well.
  - tweak: Puke now contains some of the reagents you had in your stomach, plus some
      stomach acid. We are pushing the boundaries of puke simulation technology.
  - rscdel: Removed Xenolife Technician and NT Guard.
  - tweak: Research Director is now the Chief Science Officer and may only be EC-ranked,
      not contractor.

  - maptweak: Added aluminium sheets to where metal sheets are found.
  xales:
  - tweak: Torch command (CO, XO, SEA) now share a headset type and encryption key
  - tweak: The XO now has science keys in their locker.
2019-01-26:
  Cakey:
  - rscadd: Re-adds exploration helmet-cameras.
  MistakeNot4892:
  - tweak: YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE YOUR RANK AND BRANCH PREFERENCES, READ THIS CHANGELOG.
  - tweak: Occupations panel got a visual overhall. Click the link-name of a job to
      set alt title, and click the never/high/low/medium to cycle between job weights.
  - tweak: Rank is now tracked by job, not by save slot. You can set your rank and
      branch up as you like for each given job.

  Pandolphina:
  - rscadd: Adds a new exoplanet ruin, a data capsule ejected from a ship with zombie
      juice inside.
  Textor:
  - rscadd: Escape pod blast doors now open upon reaching pod launch sequence. You
      might want to stay out of maint areas near escape pods when pods are getting
      ready to launch.
  - maptweak: After much deliberation, the Health and Safety department decided that
      Engineering, the misc laboratory, and the tunnels outside the deck 2 escape
      pods should be more well-lit.
  - maptweak: The forensics office and bridge now have chairs that can rotate.
  - maptweak: The deck 1 conference room floor has finally been repainted properly.
  - maptweak: The R-UST now has its own power monitor installed and a gas injector
      and a port to allow engineers to inject various gasses into the R-UST chamber
      if they want.
  - maptweak: Deck 3 has more emergency shutters to prevent the spread of fire and
      decompression and prevent hapless engineers from wandering into unknown danger
      outside the EVA room.
  - bugfix: Fixes deck 5 subgrid configuration.
  - bugfix: Fixes stasis cages.
  - maptweak: Replaces ready room with adherent maintenance. Ding.

  - rscdel: Removed iced tea dispenser. Combine ice and the tea of your choice to
      create iced tea.
  - rscadd: Added flavour pods and sugar packs to the hot drinks vendor to flavour
      your tea or coffee.
  - rscadd: 'Added two new mixed tea drinks: Baron Grey is prepared by mixing black
      tea and orange juice, and Maghrebi mint tea is prepared by mixing sweet green
      tea and mint.'
  - rscadd: Added teacups to the cutlery vendor.
  - rscadd: Added chazuke. It can be prepared by mixing ten parts rice and one part
      green tea in any container. Microwaving ten parts chazuke will result in a snack
      bowl meal.
  - rscadd: Added aluminium and plastic into the protolathe system. Many recipes have
      been adjusted.
  - maptweak: Removed protolathe from the robotics laboratory.

  - bugfix: Fixed/removed the cap on away site jobs' skills.
  sabiram:
  - tweak: The circuit printer and protolathe can now hold more materiel.
2019-02-05:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: Pilot skill description now clarifies random movement occurs until trained
      or greater, regardless of what ship you are flying.
  - bugfix: Fixed phoron glass sheet's melting temperature so that reinforced phoron
      glass is consistent with the pre-material overhaul melting temperature. This
      should stop the random window breakage in the engine core until close to delamination
      temperatures.
  - tweak: Due to the nature of the material overhaul and this change, regular un-reinforced
      phoron glass also gets its temperature significantly buffed. It's still weak
      to physical attack by comparison to reinforced phoron glass.
  Cakey:
  - maptweak: Added LPA equipment closet to the Workplace Liason's office.
  - tweak: Added "Asset Protection Agent" as an alt title to LPA.
  - tweak: You can now put people onto wall frames with grabs
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Added an exploration shotgun. It's in a wall locker on Charon, along with
      ammo, replacing netgun. What can possibly go wrong?
  - rscadd: It can fire freely off-ship, but onboard you gotta register and get XO
      or CO to authorize it. Yes it's pain, yes it's intended.
  - rscadd: It is only guaranteed to work with types of ammo it ships with - beanbags,
      flash, net rounds. Loading combat ammo voids warranty and may result in fun.
  Datraen:
  - rscadd: Adds Skrellian Weapons, currently admin spawn only.
  Herigony:
  - bugfix: Fixed admin jobban panel
  Textor:
  - bugfix: After paperwork being filled out in triplicate, lost, found, and buried
      in peat for two weeks, the CSO now has access to their uniform in the uniform
      vendor.
  - bugfix: You now need to be an EC scientist to select an EC labcoat in loadout.
      Senior Researchers and Assistants now have access to some of the same stuff
      as normal scientists that they lacked. Also adds some equipment the biomech
      should have access to.
  - bugfix: Non-senior researcher Ensigns in the science department are now properly
      considered officers and have an officer's uniform given to them when they wake
      up instead of an enlisted uniform.
  - rscadd: Labcoats can now be issued via the uniform vendor for EC science people.
  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Added the CSO's rigsuit.
  - maptweak: Removed the AMI rigsuit module from the CSO's Petrov office and added
      the new rigsuit to the bridge EVA storage.
  - maptweak: Resized and reorganised the bridge EVA storage.
  - rscadd: 'Added new wood material types: mahogany, maple, walnut, and ebony. These
      types are largely identical apart from their colour.'
  - rscadd: Added supply crates to obtain the new woods.
  - maptweak: Several tables and chairs across the ship that were previously generic
      wood are now made from mahogany, maple, or walnut.
  - maptweak: Shuffled things around a bit in the captain's quadrant.
  - maptweak: Moved the CSO's primary office back to the bridge, from the Petrov.
  - rscadd: Clipboards are now a material item and can be constructed from most materials.
      Clipboards that spawn around the map will be of various materials.
2019-02-06:
  ghostsheet:
  - maptweak: Rearranged the Guppy's interior for quality of life conveniences.
  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Radiation collector arrays will now fail catastrophically if exposed to
      extreme temperatures, such as those found within the supermatter core.
  - maptweak: The robotics lab has been messed with again, everything should work
      now hopefully.
2019-02-07:
  comma:
  - tweak: The year is 2307 now. Roleplay accordingly.
  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Added explosive harpoons to the uplink. These will only explode upon embedding
      in a target, by throwing it at them or sticking them close up.
  - tweak: Increased the base harpoon's throwing force divisor.
2019-02-08:
  Datraen:
  - bugfix: Fixes incorrect access on hangar maintenance doors.
2019-02-09:
  Anton-Kr:
  - rscadd: Adds Vox ship and base to the game. It's join-able as a submap.

      big guns are gone, only pistol-likes available now.
  - tweak: Wall of text about clothing items property is moved to a codex entry for
      the item, instead of being shown on every examine.
  sabiram:
  - maptweak: The king of goats in the hydrobase planetary ruin has been retired.
2019-02-12:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: CPR changes. It now will help with blood circulation even if it fails
      to restart the heart, so there's a reason to do it (especially on higher levels).
      Fake circulation lasts 20 seconds and is better with Anatomy/Medicine skill
      (highest).
  - rscadd: Can now put IV bags etc on rollerbeds and use them as IV stands for buckled
      people. Click with beaker to add it. Click with empty hand on empty (no buckled
      guy) bed to remove it. Drag bed on people to hook/unhook.
  - rscdel: Damaged livers no longer generate ammonia. It was creating self-perpetuating
      damage which wasn't intended, it was for diagnostic memes.
  - rscadd: Adds auto-CPR device. Goes into victim's suit slot. It won't do mouth-to-mouth
      or resusticate them, but it will help with circulation. Needs Basic Anatomy
      and Medicine skills to use, or risk rib fracture. Basically continuously applies
      circulation part of CPR. Mapped bunch of them in medbay
  - tweak: Sleepers now have 10x stasis option. Their power usage now also scales
      with stasis factor greatly, 500 per factor, so ~5000 W at 10x
  - rscadd: Guns suck now.
  - tweak: When you have a gun in activa hand, you're considered to be 'aiming'. Moving
      or changing active hand resets timer.
  - tweak: Aiming gives bonuses to accuracy, longer you aim, capped by accuracy of
      the gun - so no point in aiming longer than few secs with pistol, but with sniper
      rifle, take your time.
  - tweak: If you haven't stood still for at least a second, you get penalties based
      on size of your gun. Pistols are almost not affected, but rifles are affected
      greatly.
  - tweak: Accuracy falloff differs for different calibers. Pistol rounds are best
      used 4 tiles or closer, rifles can be used from any range without ok results.
      Lasers mirror that setup, with higher range.
  - tweak: Overall, pistols are now useless at range, but don't suffer much if you
      move around or change hand to do something else.
  - tweak: Rifles are oppsite, can hit if you aim even from other end of screen, but
      if you move around, you're not going to hit shit.
  - tweak: Moving around (not towards gun) will make you harder to hit now. Yakkety
      sax away.
  - rscadd: Added a small bells ringing sound playing when you regain consciousness.
      Will only play if player is considered AFK (currently 5 minutes without activity)
  Spookerton:
  - tweak: Mercenary and Raider game modes no longer do early round-end votes when
      the antagonists leave or die.
  afterthought2:
  - rscdel: Guns and armor are no longer available in personal command lockers.
  - tweak: The bridge sidearms closet now also has three sets of command armor.

  Textor:
  - maptweak: The battery backup PSU in telecomms has been moved after many Chief
      Engineers and Senior Engineers have complained about its disruptive location.
      The battery backup PSU also now recharges off of the deck 3 subgrid rather than
      making a loopback off of the telecomms subgrid. Grey outlines have been moved
      around in telecomms to be more consistent with the rest of telecomms' appearance.
  - tweak: All telecomms machinery and computers have been updated to use NanoUI style
      interfaces, bringing them in line with the majority of UI interfaces on the
      Torch.
2019-02-15:
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Accidental gun discharge chances upped, and now it can happen when aggressively
      unholstering (hurt intent). Chance is now 20% at unskilled, 5% at Basic and
      1% at Trained.
  - tweak: When unholstering or trying to fire a safetied gun on hurt intent, there's
      now a chance you automatically unsafety it. Chance is 0% at unskilled, 25% at
      Basic and 50% at Trained, guaranteed above.
  RyanSmake:
  - rscadd: You can now interact with emergency shutters through ladders and open
      spaces.
  SierraKomodo:
  - maptweak: Added air and fire alarms to the deck 4 hanger catwalks.
2019-02-18:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Crypods now have more immulsion. When joining round you will spawn inside
      a pod, asleep for 1-5 seconds. Roleplay accordingly.
  - tweak: Can now place auto-cpr device on people by clicking on them with it on
      help intent.
  afterthought2:
  - experiment: No stasis bags are available on spawn on the Torch, except one on
      the Charon.
  - tweak: Stasis bags can now be printed from the protolathe.
  - tweak: Stasis bags are now more expensive when ordered from supply.
  - tweak: Rollerbeds can now be placed in backpacks.
  comma:
  - tweak: Autopsy scanner can now be used on severed organs to get some information.
      No trace chems or time of death though, need body for that.
2019-02-19:
  afterthought2:
  - tweak: Modular consoles will no longer have access to NTnet when off-station.
  comma:
  - rscadd: Mountains can now spawn on any type of planet
2019-02-20:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Added rescue bags. Work like bodybags, but provide atmosphere from attached
      gas tank. Will set internal atmosphere of the bag to tank's release pressure.
      Use screwdriver to remove tank.

  - rscadd: Breaking a soulstone into shards and stabbing them into a wizard (or firing
      a null rod out of a pneumo cannon hard enough to embed it) will now prevent
      the wizard from casting spells.
  - rscadd: Added supporting code for psionics.
  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Added chevaux de frise, or spiky barriers. They're constructed by first
      building a barricade of any valid material, and then attaching rods of any material
      to the barricade. It will damage anyone who walks into it.
2019-02-23:
  BlueNexus:
  - rscadd: Added Venaxilin, a powerful antivenom made with spider venom.
  - rscadd: Added leporazine variants, which are made by either heating up or cooling
      down leporazine. Heating it up makes a chem that raises body temperature, cooling
      it down makes one that lowers it.
  Textor:
  - rscadd: Adds new global preference to opt into having your ckey displayed in the
      credits. This is set to hide your ckey by default.
  - tweak: Adds additional snark to the end of the credits and some new randomly generated

  - tweak: Door access has been substantially reworked. Please report any anomalies.
2019-02-26:
  Piccione/Textor:
  - rscadd: Adds new duty gloves for utility uniforms. They are available in some
      lockers and via the uniform vendor. All gloves offer some protection, and engineering
      gloves are also insulated.
  SierraKomodo:
  - bugfix: Officer's Mess doors will have the correct access flags again.
  afterthought2:
  - tweak: Arbitrary shuttles can no longer land at restricted landmarks.
  xales:
  - tweak: Adherent eyes have been upgraded. They no longer need a welding mask to

      on deck 4, in addition to more escape pod direction signs to make sure confused
      passengers know where to go to find pods on decks 2 and 4, and the deck 2 stairwell
      is now more well-lit.

      conform with the aesthetic on the rest of the ship.
  - rscadd: After evaluating flaws in  evacuation procedures, all escape pod outer
      hatches now have a manual bolt override that can be manipulated with a wrench
      after opening the cover in the event that the power is offline. As a reminder,
      the outer hatch must be closed and the bolts re-engaged before the pod will
      launch.
  - tweak: Code Delta announcement no longer specifically mentions self destruct due
      to rare cases in which it is engaged without the destruct mechanism being online.

      against rad and ion storms.
2019-03-09:
  MistakeNot4892:

      medpacks for adherent and golems.
  - tweak: Golems can now be operated on by substituting a surgical drill for a scalpel,
      and resin packs for bone gel/fixovein/medpacks/cautery.

  - bugfix: Condiment containers can no longer be stored inside food.
2019-03-10:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: Atmos pumps have all had their power limits increased considerably. This
      means atmospherics will operate faster, but at the cost of much more power at
      peak performance. In addition, vents and scrubbers will operate faster when
      stressed, but they too will cause a tremendous power spike in a ship wide atmos
      contamination emergency where a huge number of scrubbers have to work hard (from
      a badly clogged waste line, for example). A flooded deck can also overload a
      deck substation, so bypass switching may be required in such cases. Beware of
      extreme scrubber overload!
  - tweak: Filter pressure limits raised to 15,000 kpa. They are still not powerful
      devices when pumping from low to high pressures. You should put pumps around
      them if you intend them to work quickly with moving pressures in a non-passive
      manner.
  FTangSteve:
  - maptweak: deck 2 hallway by janitorial now dimmer and with no cameras
  SierraKomodo:
  - bugfix: Medical is now restricted access again.
  SierraKomodo & Anticept:
  - tweak: Flight manifest input box no longer shows the rank to make it easier to
      find personel in the list. The report itself will show the rank.

      should be more consistent.
  sabiram:
  - tweak: Most castes of giant spider will generally do more damage, and may have
      more health.
2019-03-11:
  SierraKomodo:
  - tweak: You can no longer use headsets while sedated or sleepy-penned due to paralysis
      making you unable to use your hands.
  afirpo:
  - bugfix: now the Core Sampler (Xenoarcheologist and perhaps Anomalist related)
      works again - the sample is spitted out from its sample \ evidence bag.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Adds the proxy command to terminals. This lets you obfuscate your nid
      by routing through another computer. Requires access_network and experienced
      skill. Generates local logs on the machine you route through, stored as a file
      on the hard drive.
2019-03-12:
  SierraKomodo:
  - maptweak: Added fire shutters to the cargo warehouse shutters
  Spookerton:
  - bugfix: Inappropriate crew and passengers no longer have supply program admin
      rights.

      crashes.
2019-03-14:
  Datraen:

      own shuttle (capable of overmap travel as well)
  Higgin:
  - tweak: Traitor TTVs now share power with merc TTVs.  They were underwhelming for
      40 TC cost.
  SierraKomodo:
  - bugfix: Windoors will now ignore walls when determining autoset access. This should
      fix hardsuit windoors.
  afterthought2:
  - tweak: Unathi brute mod for the subspecies has been decreased a lot.
  - tweak: Unathi healing can only be toggled once every two minutes. It cannot be
      toggled within a minute of being hit in combat.
  - tweak: Unathi limb and organ regeneration is only possible when the heal can be
      toggled.
  - tweak: When an unathi is at extreme levels of hunger, it no longer receives healing
      from the passive heal ability. Instead, it takes internal organ damage, converting
      it into nutrition. This is inefficient, so if the healing ability is left on,
      it will die quickly.
  - tweak: Unathi passive healing is less nutrition-efficient now.
2019-03-15:
  SierraKomodo:
  - tweak: Prone mobs can no longer buckle other mobs to beds/chairs. This prevents
      crawling bucklespam during combat.

  - maptweak: The Deck Chief's office now has a guest pass terminal.
2019-03-17:
  MistakeNot4892:
  - rscdel: The flying pizza sprites are no longer available to crew robot modules.
  - rscadd: A flying robot frame can now be constructed as an alternative to standard
      robot. It uses the same arms, chest and head as the regular robot, but needs
      the 'flyer' frame.
  - rscadd: Flying robot frames produce flying robots, which use the flying pizza
      sprites and can pass over tables. They have a selection of unique modules to
      pick from and are generally faster but more fragile.
2019-03-18:
  SierraKomodo:
  - bugfix: Chairs and stools now have the correct materials when constructed and
      deconstructed.
  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Added bamboo seeds to the vendors. Their produce can be chopped up into

  - rscadd: Wood rendered from the produce of the bamboo plant will now be the bamboo
      material.
  - balance: Blobs will now spread and attack diagonally.
  - balance: Blob attacks now take into account armour.
  - tweak: Blob attack damage now depends on the individual blob segment attacking
      you. The core defends itself the most vigorously.
  - tweak: Blobs now attack with a random damage type.
  - rscadd: You can now attempt to remove a sample from blobs by attacking it with
      wire cutters. The regular blobs produce fairly powerful weapons in various damage
      types, and the nuclei produce cores which can be disassembled for research points.
  - tweak: Cigarettes and the like can now be lit by more hot objects such as plasma
      cutters, and some tendrils snipped from the blob.
2019-03-24:
  Spookerton:
  - bugfix: Robot organs in meat bodies can be repaired with nanopaste in surgery.

  Higgin:
  - tweak: Push-time now depends on the difference of CQC skill between the two parties.
  - tweak: At equal skill levels, pushing has a very short duration.

      the victim is stunned, unconscious, or on help intent.

  afterthought2:
  - tweak: The shield generator has been reworked. It is now much more expensive to
      keep the shields on continuously, and for large shields it's likely not viable.
  - rscadd: The shield generator now has an idle and active state (as well as the
      off state). In the idle state, it consumes limited power and does not generate
      a shield. In the active state, it consumes a lot of power and produces a shield.
  - rscadd: If an idle generator is toggled on, it takes a short amount of time to
      spin up to active state. If an active generator is toggled to idle, it will
      switch to that state instantly.
  - rscadd: There are several levels of idle power usage that can be selected. Higher
      power usage decreases the spin-up time proportionately.

      radius will not be adjusted while the shield is active.
  - tweak: The shield generator's power storage has been vastly expanded.

      damage, and shock mode replaced by a mode that scatters low damage pellets in
      a burst.

      gun's charge to push, deafen, and dizzy an opponent. Ear protection such as

      as garbage planets.
  - tweak: Grilles have had most of their radiation resistance removed.

      give you 1 in that tech.
  - rscdel: Removes Arcane Tech, as it did nothing.

      incase you forget / join the round late.
2019-08-16:
  mikomyazaki:

2019-08-17:

  - maptweak: Torch's fuel pipes have been slightly remapped into safer positions
      with parts segmented by automatic shutoff valves to prevent leakage. The fuel
      lines has also been removed completed from the SM heating element (although
      the HE pipes are still there) and they should now be able to survive an SM delamination.
      To balance out these safety features, fuel line pressure has been doubled to
      increase the risk of bodily harm.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Glasses that apply a vision overlay (mesons, tactical goggles, etc.) will
      no longer function when you are using a sensor console to view the overmap.
2019-08-19:

      chop them down. It'll take a short time, faster if you have Trained botany skill.
