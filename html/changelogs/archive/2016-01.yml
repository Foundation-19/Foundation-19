      inputs, all SMESes inputting from one power network will split the available
      power by percentage.
  - tweak: 'Some minor SMES configuration changes have been made: Atmospherics SMES
      now starts configured to prevent power outages when people forget about it,

      RCD. It is fairly expensive, requiring small amount of gold and silver, as well
      as phoron and steel to build.

      (it will be more or less same as actual floodlight), at the cost of higher power
      usage.

      synth's maximal capacity. Better matter bin adds more capacity

      mode before exploding during delamination.

      include: Broken lights (as it''s now), Hacked APCs (same as when emagged), or
      outright broken APCs with more severe event variants. Each affected APC will
      also shut down briefly, this causes station-wide power outages until the storm
      passes. Stronger storms last for longer and affect more APCs at once.'

      likely to break the targeted limb before it would dislocate.

      an air alarm, and have normal ventillation. This air alarm will trigger a warning
      at 30C, and alarm at 40C, which is also the point at which machines begin taking
      damage.

      inside the station is safe. Also boosts solar panel output significantly for
      the duration.'
  Yoshax:
  - rscadd: Added towels to the loadout. These can be worn on the head, belt or outwear
      slots. You can also whip people with them for a special message and sound! In
      addition, using them in-hand will produce an emote where your towel yourself
      off.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: The PDA messaging server now reboots automatically after a power outage.
      This reboot takes about twenty seconds.
  - tweak: Minor mapping changes to wiring and areas on the station. Brig has few

2016-06-20:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: EMPs now randomly set suit sensors, with strength affecting the probability
      of which mode is selected.
  - rscadd: Because suit sensors can be affected externally a multitool can now be
      used to (un)lock the controls, to for example allow re-adjusting prisoner uniforms.
  - rscadd: Because suit sensors can be locked the antag uplink now offers tools and
      services which are able to jam suit sensors in various ways.
  - rscadd: Adds random events which will garble suit sensor data.
2016-06-22:
  Asanadas:

      pressure will get blood on your hands.
  - rscadd: Splints and hardsuits that support broken limbs will automatically apply
      pressure.
  - rscadd: Wounds that require treatment (e.g. bandage) to stop bleeding will be
      bolded in the examine output. Wounds that will eventually stop bleeding on their
      own are not bolded.

      areas they cannot access.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Racks will automatically align their contents.
  - tweak: Tables use an invisible 8x8 grid for item placement.

  - bugfix: Sets center_of_mass for tools and chemistry reagent containers.
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      dyed Vox hair! Within reason.
2016-07-09:
  HarpyEagle:

      and body fluid cook-off.
  - rscadd: Armor that provides 'bio' protection will now protect against the effects
      of slime feeding. Slimes can still glomp you, however, and are still dangerous
      even if you are wearing biohazard suits.
2016-07-12:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Random event probabilities have been changed a bit. This is mostly noticeable
      with electrical storms, which should be less common now.
  - tweak: Electrical storm now shuts down APCs for longer duration which is controlled
      by event severity. APCs with critical flag are now affected too, but are only
      shut down for a short time in comparison to others.
  - tweak: EMPs are no longer one-hit kills for AIs - APCs with critical flag take
      reduced damage from EMPs, and AI's power restoration routine now resets the
      APC that may have been EMPed.
  - tweak: AI's power usage has been overhauled. Under the hood changes should improve
      reliability a bit and take more scenarios in consideration. The power restoration
      routine now provides better feedback to the AI if it fails, such as, whether
      the APC is broken or only discharged, etc.
  - rscadd: AI now has a Shutdown verb that can be used to reduce it's power usage
      five times. This disables AI's control, cameras, and most communications as
      if it was without power. This verb acts as a toggle, so it can be used again
      to turn yourself back on.
  - rscadd: AI now has Toggle Power Override verb that can be used to disable power
      saving mode when it loses APC power. This results in much faster discharge of
      internal capacitor, but allows you to operate as if you were powered. Can be
      toggled at any time.
2016-07-13:
  HarpyEagle:
  - tweak: Voidsuits and cyber suits are now more shock resistant, now roughly between
      hardsuits and thick clothing.
2016-07-14:

      power is reduced considerably (stationwide shield is approx. 1.1MW at full strength).
      Shields still use a lot of power when regenerating.
  - tweak: Shield capacitors now act as actual capacitors. Their power storage is
      2 GJ, and maximal input 4MW, as opposed to 8MJ/400kW it was now.
  - tweak: Shield generator+capacitor UI now displays in kilowatts and megawatts instead
      of watts where applicable.

  Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Moved airlock electronics, brig doors, portable canisters, and cargo computers
      over to TGUI
  - tweak: Cargo ordering computers have been completely reworked. Both the supply
      and ordering computer have been merged into one which can be logged into or
      out of by a crew member with cargo access. The computers will allow only one
      computer to be logged in as a register at a time and orders cannot be placed
      without a register active.
  - tweak: The cargo ordering system has been tweaked to allow requests even when
      there are not enough points available so that cargo can queue items into their
      cart at their discretion. Items moved to the cart can be demoted back to requests
      as well.
  - rscadd: The cargo computer now allows crew members to print a receipt of their
      requests for their onw use.
  - soundadd: Added sounds for printing from the cargo computer for more ambient sounds.
  - experiment: The cargo computer will quietly beep whenever a successful ui button
      press is completed. This is an experimental test to see if more ambience can
      be added without becoming too much of an annoyance.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Adds maintenance braces. These can be printed by research and used to
      lock down an airlock. Braces can be removed with paired keycard or maintenance
      jack tool (also available from research). Braces prevent the airlock from opening
      via any means, and absorb a lot of damage until they break off, protecting the
      airlock.
2016-07-23:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Some antag uplink weapons now come with ammunition (and a container to
      hold them) and their price and description has been updated accordingly.

  atlantiscze:

      be called by admins, or as an alternative to crew transfer.
  - tweak: Add Antagonist is no longer an alternative to crew transfer during Extended
      gamemode. The intention is to keep that gamemode antagonist-free, as it was
      originally intended.
  - rscadd: Players in the lobby will now see which antagonist types were added to
      the game. This is displayed below the gamemode's name in the Lobby tab.

  - rscadd: Prevented weeds from entangling species with the NO_SLIP flag.
2016-08-06:
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added status display icons for green, blue and delta alerts.
  - rscadd: Status displays now have coloured lights for alert icons.
  Zuhayr, GinjaNinja32, and Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Implemented full body prosthetics. Full Body prosthetics (FBPs) allow
      replacement of the entire body with cyborg components and replacement of internal
      organs with synethic or assisted counterparts. Players can create a FBP character
      by selecting full body in the limbs section of character preferences.
  - rscadd: FBPs gain the benefits of a stronger body and no longer requiring breathing,
      but are prone to overheating much like IPCs and can take pressure damage in
      space. If you play an FBP, be sure to wear a suit and cooler!
  - rscadd: IPC monitor screens are now a seperate object in the loadout menu. IPCs
      can select a variety of other heads from other prosthetic manufacturing companies
      to change their head and body appearance.
  - imageadd: IPC monitor screens have an object sprite that's synced to their mob
      sprite.
  - tweak: Rebalanced IPC brute and burn modifiers due to the introduction of FBPs.
      These settings may be tweaked again in the future after gameplay has been conducted.
2016-08-07:
  Asanadas:
  - bugfix: 'Brings an end to the deadly feud between two of the Exodus''s mascots:
      Pun pun, and Officer Beepsky.'
2016-08-08:

  - rscadd: Ghosts can flicker lights when the round is spooky enough.
2016-08-11:
  Haswell:
  - tweak: Engi-Vend and Robco Tool Maker machines can now be used by atmospheric
      technicians.
2016-08-15:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Neural laces can now be destructed and created in a proper research lab.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Invented supermatter grenades and made them available to certain sets
      of antags.
  - rscadd: The antag uplink now allows you to also buy x1 grenades, in addition to
      the x5 sets, with some markup.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds ability for merchants to fast buy via cash using a banking system.
  - rscadd: Adds ability for players to sell things to merchants. They will only take
      things they like.
2016-08-18:
  Haswell:
  - tweak: The autopilot on the escape shuttle can no longer be overridden during
      crew transfers while on blue alert or lower. It can only be overridden during
      an evacuation, or during an alert level higher than blue.
  Karolis2011:
  - rscadd: Added whole map capture tool, only accessable by admins.
2016-08-22:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: The Exodus robotics lab has a newly installed Robotech deluxe (we found
      it out in the shed). Also, a new light switch.
2016-08-26:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Dug out an old engineering vending machine and added it to the engineering
      workshop.
  Soadreqm:
  - rscadd: Made tape recorders use removable 10-minute cassettes instead of 60-minute
      internal storage.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds four new traders, a robot trader, a pet trader, a replica trader,
      and a prank trader.
  - rscadd: Adds unique items (and a bot) for the traders to sell.
  - rscadd: Adds missing item worth values to the list.
  - tweak: Unique NPCs now stay around for twice as long.
  - tweak: Tweaks Hostile mob AI, so that if they have no faction at all, they will
      target nobody.
  - tweak: Spawner grenade can now set variables (using a list) upon spawning whatever
      it spawns.
2016-08-28:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Telecrystal amount increased from 25 too 100 with uplink costs adjusted
      accordingly, all to allow even more price differentiation.
  - tweak: A five pack of grenades is now 20% cheaper than buying them one at a time.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Power cell no longer use magical charge units. Instead they are rated in
      WattHours. For example, a cell with rating of 1000 will be capable of providing
      1000 watts for one hour. (or 2000 watts for half a hour, etc.)
  - tweak: In general this means that a power cell with rating of 1000 will hold MUCH
      more energy than it held before. To balance this out, power cell capacities
      have been reduced considerably. When these two changes add up the cells last
      for approximately same time as they used to.
  - tweak: As part of this change, higher grade power cells have became a bit more
      rare. Research can still fabricate them in bulk, but they are much rarer from
      random spawns, and no longer available from vending machines. Vending machines
      provide standard cells instead. EngiVend can be hacked to provide few high capacity
      ones.
  - tweak: Vending machines no longer shoot objects at people when malfunctioning.
      They merely shudder and dump the item on the ground. This should make the random
      event a little bit less annoying.
  - tweak: Space heater's default temperature setting is now 20C (changed from 50C),
      which is the default station temperature. It can still be changed via the UI
      when the panel is open.
2016-08-29:
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added /vg/ direct-action ventcrawling. You will now crawl through the
      actual pipe network, a step at a time. Have fun.
2016-08-30:
  Haswell:
  - rscdel: Atmospheric technician is now unavailable for general play.
  - rscadd: Alt title 'Atmospheric Technician' is now added to engineers.
  - tweak: Engineers now have all the accesses atmospheric technicians previously
      held.
  - tweak: Tweaked job selection screen to properly indicate which jobs aren't available
      to play as.
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: Cultists don't need to research words anymore.
  - tweak: Astral journey's damage over time lowered to sane levels.
  - tweak: Changeling revive, when the timer is up, will now give you a verb that
      revives you, allowing you to choose when to get up, instead of doing it immediately.
  - tweak: Changelings will always get DNA, species, and languages together, be it
      via absorbtion, DNA sting, or hive channel.
  - tweak: Changeling transform and change species was merged.
  - tweak: Changelings no longer display gender in changeling chat.
2016-09-02:
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Medical splints can now also be applied to hands and feet (in addition
      to arms and legs).
  - rscadd: For those that miss the old functionality, ghetto splints have been added.
      These can be crafted with a roll of tape and a metal rod and can only splint
      arms and legs.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Converts few other things over to work with the recent CELLRATE change.
      This fixes various issues where battery life of some things (drills, etc.) was
      very short, while some other things had power cells with very large capacities.
  - tweak: Hardsuits and Mechas now use energy in joules rather than Wh (this fixes
      Ninja suit, among others). Various exosuit tools now have rebalanced power usage.
      Energy based exosuit weapons use energy on per-shot basis, ballistic weapons
      use single massive spike when fabricating a new magazine.
  - tweak: Minor power-related changes to exosuit modules. Energy cost of some offensive
      modules increased a bit.
  - tweak: Added short cooldown for teleporter module to prevent spamming.
  - tweak: Added power usage to various industrial/science modules (anomaly scanner,
      various drills, etc.).
  - tweak: Increased mounted RCD power usage by a lot (matter fabrication is very
      power demanding process).
  - tweak: Powersink module is limited to 120kW transfer rate, and is slower (30kW)
      when used on APCs with enabled interface lock. Furthermore, when draining from
      APC it first tries to take energy from the grid, before resorting to taking
      it from the cell.
  - bugfix: APCs drained by a ninja no longer get stuck on 0% charge, and instead
      recharge themselves as usual.
  - rscadd: Repair capability of upgraded cyborg rechargers now also works on IPCs
      and FBPs.
  - tweak: If the cyborg recharger is upgraded enough, it will be capable of rebooting
      (and eventually repairing) destroyed modules, for some extra power.
2016-09-03:
  Haswell:
  - rscadd: Added a fashion vending machine in the locker room for snowflake loadout

      future.
  - tweak: Picks renamed to show their excavation depths.
  - tweak: Suspension generator's power use lowered.
  - tweak: Suspension generator's different field types removed. By the way, remember
      that they can suspend any item and even mobs.
  - tweak: Archeology belts and pick sets can now hold small pickaxes. Pick sets still
      only have 7 slots. Brushes fit on your ears.
  - tweak: Empty rock drop rate reduced.
  - tweak: Empty rock renamed from 'rock' to 'small rock' so you can tell if you are
      clicking on a turf or an item when hovering over it.
  - tweak: Empty boulder spawn rate reduced.
  - tweak: Tape measuring is a bit faster.
  - tweak: Scanner now shows the lowest and the highest depth of the find (highest
      is depth + clearance) for easier calculations. Ideally, you need to hit exactly
      the lowest spot. Less ideally, hit anywhere between higest and lowest. Hit below
      lowest and you have a chance to break the find.
  - tweak: You can now use a brush to clear strange rocks. Welder uses less fuel for
      that than before.
  - tweak: Anomaly analyser's report made a bit easier to read.
  - tweak: Anomaly locater will now also locate normal finds.
  - bugfix: Gas masks will now correctly spawn as archeological finds.
  - bugfix: Digsites will now properly contain several (4-12) turfs in a 5x5 radius.
      Be careful when digging near your finds.
  - bugfix: Suspension generator will now correctly turn off (qdel issue).
  - bugfix: Archeology overlays won't disappear when the icon is updated (e.g. when
      mining next to it).
  - bugfix: Archeology overlays won't overlap each other and will properly disappear
      when you mine out a find.
  - bugfix: Some spawning oddities were fixed.
  - bugfix: Checks for whether you get a strange rock or a clean item were fixed (previously
      it always gave you clean item where it should have been rolling a random number).
  - bugfix: Can no longer get rid of any item by putting it into evidence bag and
      bag into core sampler.
  - bugfix: CO2 generator effect now has a type.
  - bugfix: Phoron generator effect will now always generate phoron, not sometimes
      phoron and sometimes oxygen.
  - tweak: You can now lit smokables with cigarettes and cigars.
  - tweak: You can now explode welder tanks with all flame sources (cigarettes, lighters,
      candles, igniters, etc).
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: The impaired Resomi vision is now represented by the oxygen overlay rather
      than the welding overlay.
  - tweak: Vision impairment from wearing a welding mask now stacks with nearsightedness
      due to now being two separate effects.
  - tweak: Species and individual specific nearsightedness now stacks, i.e. a nearsighted
      Resomi won't be aided at all to the same degree by the standard prescription
      glasses as other species would be.
  - tweak: Glasses can now have varying degrees of prescription.
2016-09-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Equipment that doesn't check a specific id card for access now checks
      the collective access of all id cards in both hands and the id slot. Among other

  - rscadd: Borosilicate (phoron) glass can now be made with the mineral processor.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Created new AI restorer program, by default available on research consoles.
      Also added a new hardware piece that acts as connection between intellicard
      and a computer (laptop and console only). The new program allows AI restoration,
      as well as simple law modifications. It can also be used to purge malfunctioning
      AI's laws correctly. This program can only work on intellicarded AIs, that are
      placed in the computer itself. The program can be run/used by anyone, but requires
      head of staff level access to download from NTNet.
  - rscdel: Removed old AI integrity restorer console
2016-09-16:
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Added camera monitoring program to modular computers, that can be run
      on consoles, laptops and tablets. Most mapped in consoles come with this program
      preinstalled.
  - tweak: Due to removal of old consoles (telescreens were part of these consoles),
      entertainment monitors were replaced with civilian modular console where applicable.
      This console can be used to access the entertainment channels.
  - rscdel: Removed old camera consoles, including circuit boards and other related
      things.

  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Ghosts AND AI eyes can travel zlevels again with Move Upwards/Down verbs.
  - rscadd: Humans can too, with either working jetpack or wearing magboots and near
      a wall (climbing). Don't try in gravity-working areas though, you'll still drop.
  Haswell:
  - maptweak: Readded missing blast shutters on mercenary shuttle and Skipjack.
  - maptweak: Removed random steel floor tiles.
  - maptweak: Added random coin spawns.

      areas.
  - maptweak: The engineering washroom now has two entrances.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Vastly increases amount of water held in fire extinguishers and water tanks.
2016-09-23:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: The antag uplink now offers energy guns in the 'Highly Visible and Dangerous
      Weapons' category.
  Szunti:
  - bugfix: Acids, plant-b-gone etc. kill weeds instead of growing them. Sugar grows
      them instead of killing.
2016-09-25:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now pick color of labcoat in loadout menu, replacing separate preset
      colored coats. My condolences to those who had preset ones.
  Haswell:
  - maptweak: Added lots of random spawns in maintenance, replacing most old mapped
      in items.
2016-09-26:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Malfunctioning AI ability Basic Encryption Hack now lists station APCs
      first. Off-station APCs (that do not contribute to CPU generation) are appended
      to the bottom of the list.
  - rscdel: Airlock brace keycards have been removed.
  - tweak: Airlock braces when held inhand can be accessed and configured as an airlock
      electronics circuit board. Instead of brace keycards they can now be unlocked
      by swiping an ID with configured access (or by using maintenance jack). Configuring
      the brace has no access requirement, but it can't be configured when installed
      on an airlock.
2016-09-30:
  Kasuobes:
  - rscdel: Removed IR emitters until they are fixed and don't kill servers.
2016-10-03:
  Asanadas:

2016-10-08:
  Ferracio:
  - rscadd: Name and species can now be selected for newly-constructed FBPs.

  Levyafan:
  - rscadd: Added research tape to excavation closets and xenoarchaeology lockers.
  - rscadd: Added optical meson scanners to miner lockers.

      research outpost.
  - maptweak: Mapped in a soft drinks vendomat and a coffee vendomat to the mining
      outpost.
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      are expected, please report them except if you're running a client older than
      510 in which case you have to update first.
  - tweak: The 'Show Server Revision' verb should now be more copy-paste friendly,
      in terms of adding the info to issue tickets, and now also includes the major
      client version.
2016-10-13:
  Hugo14453:

  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Added floating camera thing for Journalists, in the library office nook.
      It acts like a portable security camera on Thunderdome network. Can also send

2016-11-03:
  Broseph Stylin:
  - tweak: Most loadout items with multiple variants can now be found under lists

      so be sure to redo them.
  Siegdermaus:
  - imageadd: Adds a new icon for turret and blast area caution signs.
2016-11-04:

  - bugfix: Fixed a one-pixel mistake in one of the robotic maintenance step images.
  Broseph Stylin:
  - tweak: Most loadout items with multiple variants can now be found under lists
      in their respective categories. This change WILL mess up your saved loadouts,
      so be sure to redo them.
  Datraen:
  - tweak: Skrell now have mild darksight.
  - tweak: Skrell now prefer slightly warmer temperatures.
2016-11-08:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Blobs are now considerably more resistant to energetic weapons, be it handheld
      lasers, energy guns, or even emitters. An emitter is still useful to suppress
      the blob a bit, but one emitter shouldn't be capable of outright killing the
      blob.
  - rscadd: Blob has a relatively small chance to grow secondary cores. These cores
      are considerably weaker, have lower health, but still help spread the blob a
      bit more.
  - tweak: Emitter power usage increased (30kW to 100kW). While it is still possible
      to run one with PACMAN, you have to keep it on overload.
  - tweak: Reinforced walls are now considerably more resistant against projectiles
      of all kinds, be it emitters, handheld weaponry, or anything else. Regular walls
      are unaffected. An emitter is still useful if you need to burn through one,
      but expect to wait - it needs over fifty pulses for a plasteel reinforced wall.
  - tweak: Details on the above. Reinforcement is calculated from the material that
      is used to reinforce the girders when building the wall. Weak materials such
      as wood have 0% reduction in taken damage. Most basic materials have 50% or
      so. Steel is decent material with 80% reduction. Plasteel is very good with
      90%, and titanium is the best with approx. 92% reduction (though it has lower
      overall health)
  - rscdel: Removed bubble shield generators, hull shield generators and shield capacitors.
      Also removed shield disrupter.
  - rscadd: Added a replacement advanced shield generator, that has a combined function
      of a capacitor, and both shield generators (hull shielding is toggleable). This
      shield generator must be built and once constructed is immobile (but can be
      deconstructed again). These generators are fully configurable, have better hull
      shielding that doesn't block shuttles, mass drivers and others, and have different
      energy system. Damage will drain the shield's energy directly.
  - rscadd: Added Shield Diffusers. Two variants exist - floor mounted and handheld.
      The handheld variant can be purchased from traitor uplink, and runs on an internal
      cell. The floor mounted variant layers under floor tiles and is APC powered.
      These diffusers dissipate shields in adjacent tiles (+ shaped pattern). The
      generator can be set to try to counter these, in which case each diffuser causes
      major EM strain on the shield.
  - maptweak: Added two shield generator circuit boards and two shield diffuser circuit
      boards into tech storage.

      force or 20 or above is a guaranteed shake-off).
  - tweak: Disarming a slime or wrestling them off now has a chance to disorient them
      for a moment. Throwing them off with a weapon doesn't do that.
  - tweak: Water will make slimes lose their target, stop feeding, and will disorient
      them for a moment on the first application (they will not be stunlocked and
      repeated applications have no effect).
