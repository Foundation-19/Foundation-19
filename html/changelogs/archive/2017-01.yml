      another person who is lying on an optable''. Deviations from that add chance
      of failure. Some steps are more robust, some are more delicate. As a rule of
      a thumb, if you have to touch innards, that''s delicate. If you perform internal
      organ surgery on yourself while sitting on a table piss drunk, nearly passing

      core EPR value. This value is best kept between 1 and 2, and shows real amount
      of coolant in the core (in standard canisters worth). Normal EPR with two canisters
      in each loop is roughly 1.5
  - rscdel: Rightclick open/close laptop verb no longer exists for laptops. Use alt-click

2017-05-23:
  Asanadas:
  - tweak: Maintenance Drones now require an account of age 3 days or greater.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Bunch of virus changes. Buckle up, kiddo. Praise Nurgle
  - rscadd: Adds Space Cold event. Spawns a harmless virus that can be treated with
      cold medicine. Unless you're irradiated and it mutates to kill everyone I guess.
  - rscadd: Adds space cold medicine (dextra-something) to white first aid boxes.
      Can also be made by mixing paracetamol+sugar. Eating it will stop weak viruses
      symptoms from manifesting.
  - rscadd: Humans now have crude immune system simulation. Keeping your immunity
      high makes it easier to shrug off viruses, extremely low (15% and less) immunity
      can get you random space cold-level infections. Get lemons for boosting it,
      spaceacilin ruins it. It recovers to norm over time.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin now ODs at 15u instead of 30u.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin now metabolizes faster. It was 60+ minutes for 15u, 30 minutes
      now.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin boosts immune system effective rating. It acts as a multiplier
      to natural one, from 1x at none in blood to 2x at OD threshold (15u), and you
      can go higher if you don't mind ODing. Also if natural immunity is lower than
      the boost, boost would just replace it.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin has three stages now. Below 10 units it acts kinda like now,
      blocking badness 2 virus effects. Virus would still progress though, but effects
      won't fire. It's enough for any random event virus effects.
  - tweak: Above 10 units it would completely stop progression of badness 2 viruses
      and stop effects of badness 3 - which is usual stuff ou get from viro labs.
      Again, clock will still be ticking. Also at this stage it starts lowering your
      natural immunity value.
  - tweak: And then, there's OD. OD stops badness 4 (e.g. Gibbingtons) from manifesting,
      and stops ticking of lower viruses. It screws your immune system even stronger
      too.
  - tweak: It's also not 100% protecting you from infection now. 15u and above give
      old 100% protection, scaling with lower value in blood.
  - tweak: Some tweaks to virus annoyningness. Hard delay between firings (25-40 seconds
      between message-only syndromes), emote syndromes (groaning, moaning, screaming)
      are now single syndrome to make it rarer. Internals actually stopping you from
      spreading viruses. No airborne viruses in vacuum.
  - tweak: As an unrealated bonus, first aid (white and fire) boxes now have paracetamol
      bottles because damn it's easier to score opiates than that.
  - tweak: Oh also remember how when you graft yourself Tajaran arms it kills you?
      Not when your immunity is floored. Just saying.
  Orelbon:
  - maptweak: Tech storage has been moved to deck two, where the abandoned officers

  Asanadas:
  - bugfix: No longer will you be able to freely pass onto upright tables by moving
      onto them from a tile which has a flipped table.
  Chaoko99:
  - rscadd: Added a mass-defile cultist rune. Buyer beware; it may kill you.
  - rscadd: Cult tiles play a snazzy animation on creation.
  - rscadd: The soulstone shard now notifies the player when it is full, asks if you
      wish to release the spirit within.
  - rscdel: Removed Manifests from the cultist repertoire.
  - rscdel: Removed defile giving cultist levels.
  - tweak: Changed the values for cultiness (The value which controls spell levels).
      You will need to either recruit 10 cultists, or perform 10 sacrifices to unlock
      Nar-Sie.
  - tweak: Nerfed cultist robes. Buffed cultist voidsuits. The latter of which is
      still impossible to obtain.
  - bugfix: Made the restricted/protected/blacklisted roles for cultists torch-compatible.
  - bugfix: Fixed construct and familiar spells.
  - rscdel: Removed Vox Pariah.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now rig assemblies/devices(e.g. radio signalers) to trigger when crate
      is opened. Click wires on open crate, then click with assemblies. It would trigger
      when opened next time. Use wirecutter to unrig.
  - tweak: AI cores got new step in construction. You need to swipe an ID with Upload
      access (or emag) to hook them into the systems.
  - rscadd: Added rubber masks and suits to party crate. Dress up as war hero or SCG
      secretary or a naked tajara like you always wanted.
  - tweak: Made SHOCK mode on tasers literally useless, ruining security gameplay.
      Does bit less burn damage, and much less straight up stun damage. Not 'better
      tase mode' anymore.
  - bugfix: Fixed their primary function actually never working. If you hit arm or
      hand with the beam you can disarm someone (even diona, even robbit, pain reception
      doesn't matter). If you hit leg, they might drop, higher chance for foot.
  Hubblenaut:
  - bugfix: Manifold pipes show up properly on t-ray scanners now.
  - bugfix: Space lube now properly disappears.

  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Research module robots now have access to a welding tool.
2017-06-19:
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Speed now matters when flying into meteor field. Still - 25% the meteors,
      below 0.3 - 60% of usual, normal otherwise until above 3 speed, where you start
      getting double the fun. Also if ship is moving most meteors will fly in from
      front and sides.
  - tweak: Changes spess dust event. It used to be a single wave of quasi-meteors
      that exploded for a bit before dying. There were no further waves until you
      left and came back. Now waves keep coming ~twice a minute. Dust itself is now
      a pile of micrometeors - basically space bullets. It wouldn't do a lot of damage
      to the hull, but can break windows and makes EVA pretty damn dangerous.
  - tweak: SCG had mastered the secret art of 'background check'. CO and XO are no
      longer be eligible for roundstart antag roles on Torch. Can still be converted
      in round

2017-06-30:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Poppies now contain tramadol.
  - bugfix: Fixed the phrasing in the set-pose verb.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: NT has sent some more testing supplies. Nothing to see really. RDs can
      find details in a super secret folder in their office. Others - do no peek,
      ok.
  - tweak: Surgery now produces normal wounds instead of snowflake 'open incisions'.
      Do not be alarmed, do not bandage those if you plan to continue surgery, clamp.
      If incision was made with scalpel, you'll be able to cauterize it, healing a
      lot of damage.
  - tweak: Skull/ribs surgery changed, now you just need to use the saw to crack em.
      Fractures count as being open too. Retractor steps for ribs etc are gone, use
      normal bone repair surgery aferwards.
  - tweak: Coincidently you can just rip them apart with cut wounds to get access
      to innard surgery steps. It takes much more damage than surgical incisions though.
  - tweak: Bones now fracture when damage is taken rather than from existing damage.
      Meaning if you fix bones, they won't refracture immediately without taking damage.
  - tweak: You don't need to crack open the bones to get shrapnel now. If you can
      see it on examine, you can take it out with just a retracted incision.
  - rscadd: Added new surgery step - disinfecting wounds. You can use sterilizine
      or high proof booze, in spraybottles/droppers/bottles/glasses/buckets. Works
      same as ointment.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Adds darksight to space adapted humans
  Ravensdale:
  - tweak: Cultists now speak in the cult tongue when activating runes instead of
      their default language. Done in case a changeling cultist ever becomes a thing.
  - rscdel: Removed special human kabobs and burgers. Lumping all items that are 'red
      meat' together.
  - tweak: Adjusted AI tracking verbs. AI will now have a more difficult time tracking
      specific people depending on method and if person has their face concealed.
  - tweak: To bring some consistency for the above, also adjusted how names appear
      on mobs that have some sort of face covering or a face that is... not there.
  Zucchinsky:
  - rscadd: Beeg medical changes. Like holy crap. Get a crash course on https://wiki.baystation12.net/index.php?title=Zuhmed_Guide
  - rscadd: Death now occurs when brain dies. Brain's health replaces overall 'health'
  - rscadd: Death is now FINAL, baring relacing. Don't let that brain die.
  - rscadd: Crit now exists as flatlining, the heart failure, or as fancily 'asystole'.
      It happens when heart is damaged, not enough blood or oxygen in blood, or high
      levels of shock.
  - rscadd: In crit you do the usual gasping thing and take brain damage. USE CRP
      or defib to revive em. If they die before you crack ribs, you hadn't tried hard
      enough.
  - rscadd: '''Toxins'' damage is now overall organ failure, basically sum of organ
      damage. Poisons will try to destroy liver and kidney first, and will damage
      the rest after those two are down. Some poisons go straight for vitals. Liver
      will heal self until it''s too damaged.'
  - rscadd: '''Suffocation'' damage is now used as modifier to your blood levels.
      If you don''t get enough air, you get effects of low blood basically.'
  - rscadd: Defibs now restart failed hearts instead of reviving dead. Also named
      differently now.
  - rscadd: Most scanner readouts are changed now. Instead of damage values they report
      vitals (pulse/blood pressure/brain activity) and general state of damage.
  - rscadd: A D R E N A L I N E. When you take a good chunk of damage at once (15
      or more in one hit) you generate bit of adrenaline reagent according to damage
      taken. It acts like strong painkiller / pulse raiser for a tick or two, becoming
      weaker after that.
  - rscadd: FBPs and IPCs now have batteries in their chests. They have HYPERCELLS
      and drain when they stand (unbuckled) or move around (double drain then).
  - rscadd: Sleepers now have stomach pumps, same as filtering but for ingested stuff.
  - rscadd: Cultists yo - sacrifice rune now works on someone in asystole rather than
      full braindeath. Knives now count for all steps needed to cut out the heart,
      and cult runes count as surgery spots. Just sayin'.
  - rscadd: Bunch of chems is different now. First off, none 'reduce' toxins damage,
      aside from peridaxon cause tht's organ damage now.
  - rscadd: Peridaxon only treats brain damage if it's not too severe. Get Alkysine
      otherwise.
  - rscadd: Alkysine will only work if brain is fully oxygenated, so refill blood
      and air first.
  - rscadd: Dylovene removes toxic reagents from blood.
  - rscadd: Dexlaine fools brain into thinking you got at least 50% of air you needed.
      For Dex+ it's 80%.
  - rscadd: Cryox/Clonex also have Dex/Dex+ effect respectively.
  - rscadd: Inapro prevents suffocating while in asystole, slows pulse down (which
      slows bleeding a bit) and has mild painkiller effect as it did.
2017-07-06:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Added a full belt to engineering lockers.

  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now scoop corgis up, like cats or nymphs etc.

      fit.

  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Made it so a butterfly knife spawns in your hand instead of on the floor
      when completed.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Bluespace jump effects have changed. Engineers found that some duct tape
      got unstuck because of a WD40 leak, so they fixed it. Now you can't zoom through
      the walls, and visibility is a bit better. You also don't get confused forever,
      just for a minute or so. There are some... unforseen side effects, but they
      seem harmless. A word from Chief Tech (before his disappearace) - KEEP IT REAL.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Gives holowarrants their own handheld item.

  - tweak: Lowered the max damage of internal organs, except for the brain and cortical
      stack.
  - tweak: Prosthetic internal organs are now stronger then regular organs.

  - rscadd: Prosthetic lungs half the toxin damage taken from breathing bad air.

  - rscadd: Can now order OCP and plasteel from cargo. Furthermore, 10 and 50 sheet

      This program is available for download on all emagged devices, but relies on
      ID card slot hardware. When executed it slowly (takes about 3-6 minutes, depending
      on the device''s CPU) hacks the network and when finished adds a random access
      to the ID. ID must be kept inside the device while running. Can be repeatedly
      used to get multiple accesses. Has chance of yielding access that''s already
      present on the ID, and therefore will do nothing wasting some time.'
  Broseph Stylin:
  - rscadd: Added weight lifting machines and punching bags. They provide no mechanical
      benefits, and will deplete your nutrition as they're used. The weight machine

      to use the punching bags.

      ID.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Slimetoxin. Slimetoxin changed. Instead of pop and go slimeficiation it's
      now a life threatening process. Slime toxin metabolizes slowly, and deals fair
      bit of toxins damage. For every unit or so metabolized, it mutates one limb.
      Once every limb mutated, there's a 10% every tick to fully mutate into a slimegirl.
      If you're lucky, you might mutate right before death and that'd heal your all
      wounds! That' a great idea!
  Devildabeast:
  - rscadd: Adds a cyborg recharging station to the Auxiliary Head.
  - rscdel: Removes toilet from said Head.

      not much else
  - rscadd: Snowy exoplanets, like grassy but colder and with less life
  - rscadd: Desert exoplanets, rich with minerals below the surface, which is covered
      with dangerous quicksand
  - rscadd: Mountainous exoplanets, one of the three other options, but also covered
      with surface minerals
  - tweak: Additionally, the airlocks of the three shuttles aboard the Torch now cycle
      to the external atmosphere.

      all research by one level. Single-use.
  - rscadd: Added T5 Machine Upgrade ability, behind Machine Overload. Right now only
      works on APC, SMES, Turret, Turret control, Camera. It is easily expandable
      to any machinery in the future.
  - rscadd: Adds four new abilities in a new passive tree. T1 prevents intellicard
      transfers (toggleable), T2 removes BSOD/lockout from APCs, but reduces CPU generation
      (toggleable), T3 prevents hack failures, and allows you to complete system override
      silently and T4 prevents fax/emergency messages from going through.

  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Health analyzers, advanced scanners and suit sensors will now report blood
      oxygenation instead of just how well it flows in general.
  - rscadd: If you go near an edge of exoplanet, you get warped around, kinda like
      in space. Don't get lost, nerds.

      for engineering to experiment with.
  - tweak: Edits the RUST manual to fit the new setup.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: Overhauls how reagents are identified, affecting both chemistry and
      food. Due to the large scale of these changes more or less subtle bugs may have
      crept their way in.
  ThatOneGuy:
  - rscadd: Can now play as the Explorer Department if you are a EC member. If a complete
      failure, up for removal.

  - rscadd: Calypso is dead, new shuttle is here in same role - Charon.
  - rscadd: Can now hide custom loadout items that are not allowed for your job. The
      button's in top of loadout menu. Makes browsing less of pain for those with
      lots of restrictions.

  Zuhayr:
  - tweak: R-UST backend/manual changes.
2017-09-13:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Changed way lung damage affects people. Instead of straight up oxyloss,
      it now makes you require higher oxygen pressure - so you can work around it
      with high pressure internals. Of course it's not 100% failsafe, as blood coughing
      and breathing stops still remain.
  - rscadd: Inapro does more things now. It can heal brain damage up to 60, and also
      slows down brain damaging a general, more effective at higher oxygenation.
  - rscadd: Health analyzers report brain damage a bit different now. They don't report
      damage that will self-heal without meds. New stage 'minor brain damage' covers
      range that can be healed with inapro. Rest are more or less same.
  - rscadd: Painstuff tweaked around, should generally see slightly less instant KOs
      from lethal damages.
  FTangSteve:
  - tweak: Makes it so breathing heat or cold will hurt your lungs more than making
      your head explode.
  - rscadd: Electricity now shocks many parts of your body in a line to the ground
      rather than just your hand.
  - tweak: Species with an open circulatory system now don't get cut veins or arteries.
2017-09-23:

  - rscadd: Added lockers for the Pathfinder and Explorers.
  - maptweak: An Exploration Equipment area which can only be accessed by the Exploration
      department has been mapped on Deck 4 Aft.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Pulse now affects blood circulation. Lower pulse effectively lowers it
      and vice versa.
  - rscadd: Extremely high pulse risks damaging the heart. Shouldn't be a lot, but
      it's there.
  - rscadd: As you lose blood oxygenation, your pulse tries to rise to compensate.
      Thready (>250) pulse will cause a cardiac arrest.
  - rscadd: Inaprovaline tries to bring pulse to normal levels, either up or down.
      It also prevents thready pulse.
  - rscadd: Heart stopping is slightly less 100% surefire, so if you manage to get
      heart restarted it might beat for few ticks first.
  - rscadd: You no longer need lungs/mouth to give CPR, but you will only do the heart
      bit. Checks still apply for mouth-to-mouth.
  - rscadd: Shock stage stars rising earlier now (30 damage vs 50) and can go bit
      higher than usual.
  - rscadd: Painkillers speed changed. Now they ramp up slower if ingested, but stay
      longer. Opposite if injected.
  - rscadd: Tramadol and oxcodone injectors added to medical vendomats (and tramadol
      ones to hacked firstaid vendomats).
  - rscadd: Adds some goodies to survival boxes - inapro injector, food and light.
  - rscadd: Changed how tramadol/oxycodone work a bit. They now have period for setting
      in and wearing off, gradually ramping power up/down. Those are short, ~20 seconds
      to reach max
  - rscadd: Mixing those with alcohol is now as bad idea as it's supposed to be -
      increased liver damage and respiratory depression (harder time beathing) await
      you
  - rscadd: Inaprovaline helps against breathing effects of both mixing and ODing.
  - rscadd: There's now some effects based on how much you consume over time, rather
      than single dose. Effects stat at 15u with some slowdown and chance to start
      slurring, ramp up from there, with major slowdown and slurring after OD-worthy
      doses is metabolized.
  - rscadd: Also ODing on those will give you even MORE painkilling effect! At a small
      cost of suffocating most likely, and don't even try doing that AND booze.
  - rscadd: Ships now have sensors. Overmap is dark by default, with known sectors
      emitting some light. Dust/rocks/ion block visibility. You can control the sensor
      with console(s) on the bridge, its power setting sets how far it will shine.
      Higher settings use /huge/ mounts of power so don't leave it running on those.
      Sensors also cannot run in non-vacuum.
  - rscadd: Some improvements to helm console - now shows ETA to next grid, can set
      max speed for autopilot.
  - rscadd: Engines are now buildable - there's circuitboards for them in Tech storage.
  - rscadd: Merchant prices are now slightly less wack, they use actual procs for
      deciding them, instead of selling containeres full of stuff at price of container
      only.
  - rscadd: Mineral scanners now store survey data, currently useless aside from penile
      comparsions.
  - rscadd: New away mission - a drifting empty ship. Can be restored to fly around
      on its own like Torch.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Cyborgs can now unwrap packages by clicking them..
  dryerlint:
  - tweak: Autolathes can now print cable coils. They are under the Devices and Components
      category.

  - rscadd: Added a service uniform skirt for Expeditionary Corps, available in the
      uniform vendor.
  - rscadd: The clerical module robot now has access to the basic and denied rubber
      stamps. Additionally, their hacked item is now the chameleon stamp.
  - rscadd: The service department has been split. The Sol Pilot, Pathfinder and Explorer
      are now in the Utility department, with their own department radio. The hotkey
      for the utility department is 'y'. Bartender, Cook, Janitor and Crewman remain
      in the service department.
2017-10-03:
  Broseph Stylin:
  - rscadd: Added some code by Techhead that allows for accessories to have and transfer
      armor values to the item they are attached to.
  - rscadd: Added a modular armor system based around a common plate carrier and accessories
      that attach to it.
  - maptweak: Replaced the armor vests and arm guards found inside the Emergency Armory
      with equivalents using the new modular armor system.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Shrapnel is less deadly now. Tiny items don't jostle around anymore. They
      still prevent wounds they're embedded in from healing.
  - rscdel: Conductive things embedded in body will heat up in EMP, dealing damage
      depending on their size and EMP severity.
  - rscadd: Brainwashing implants! Well, kinda. XO now has a box of 'imprinting' implants,
      that can be set to a list of instructions, and will remind about those to whoever
      is implanted with it. Latest word in grimdark on-job training. They're not binding,
      just reminders.
  - rscadd: Now the fun part is their abuse - when victim has mindbreaker in blood
      and implanted with those, implant wires deep enough to fool host that he actually
      believes these. Think borg laws. You can get the kit in uplink too, bundled
      with a dose of mindbreaker
  - rscadd: Can now emag practice carbines to get lethal lasers out of them. They'll
      turn useless after 3-6 shots so bring a lot! Costs an emag charge.
  - rscadd: Not having enough air in lungs will prevent you from talking efficiently.
      If you don't have air at all, you might use remaining air in lungs for one message.
      If you're just not getting enough, you'll be stuck whispering. Long messages
      might come out garbled.
  FTangSteve:
  - rscadd: Added a push back disarm attack for GAS.
  - rscadd: Added examine text and a message for GAS stance.
  - rscadd: Adds in some of the GAS event things like the threat display and associated

      not interact' to better fit the spirit of the law and staff policy.
2017-10-10:
  Atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Completely overhauls crew records. Large text fields now support paper
      tag formatting. Records are now accessed through a computer program. Everyone
      can see generic fields (name, job, rank, ..), specialized fields become visible
      depending on your access.
  - rscdel: Removed old record computers of all kinds, removed PDA modules for crew
      record viewing.

      them.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Added doorbell pager button. Press one and it will ping all PDAs of relevant
      department people! There's one in Medical Cargo lobbies each.
  - rscadd: EC ranks have been changed, you'll probably need to update your char settings.
      Only 3 enlisted ranks now, slightly less officer ones.
  - rscadd: 'SUPER IMPORTANT: EC cannot longer be SEA. Also since they don''t have
      O2 equivalent, Pathfinder can be either O1 or O3.'
  - rscadd: Can now rename alien creatures! All exoplanet animals start as 'alien
      creature', and you can use a Name Alien Species verb to rename them when you
      see 'em. Name can't be changed afterwards so don't go too silly. Random generated
      one is suggested when you use that verb too.
  - rscadd: All computers now come with a word processor, NanoWord. Lets you edit
      TXT files, with paper preview and markup help
  CrimsonShrike:
  - rscadd: Ports openspaces. Now open turfs will show whatever is down below.
  Crushtoe:
  - rscadd: Added the antibody analyser, a new way for virology to contribute to the
      crew. Finding new antibodies from curing diseases grants 45 cargo points per
      when scanned, allowing up to 1170 points on the furthest end assuming RNGesus
      is very merciful.
  - maptweak: Mapped in an antibody analyser into the virology lab.
