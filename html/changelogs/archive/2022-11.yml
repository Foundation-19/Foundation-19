  GGarciaECE:
  - rscadd: new sprites for future guns courtesy of Civilization13
  - rscadd: glock17 (unused), M60 (new LMG maybe for MTF or perhaps add one to HCZ
      armoury, pretty op tho), Spas12 (reskin of Combat shotgun, variants that spawn
      with beanbag, slug or buckshot, 9 shells), AR12 (Semi auto shotgun with 10 shell
      mags, variants that spawn with beanbag, buckshot or slug mag initially), Saiga12
      (identical as AR12 except mags hold 8 rounds)
  - rscadd: Replaced LCZ locker room's P90's with shotguns loaded in beanbag.  Meant
      to be used in CDC as beanbag is relatively efficient and less messy than P90
      rubber
  - balance: Buffed Titanium, Plasteel and Plasteel Osmium significantly against brute
      attacks. Rifle bullets for the most part (apart from the most powerful) will
      not scratch them.
  - rscadd: HCZ spawn with ballistic armour, the hazmat armour can still be found
      in their armoury
  - rscadd: Changes to CDC and to various checkpoints to make them more utilitarians
      and less claustrophobic
  - rscadd: Add 2 pairs of sunglasses and 4 flashes (2 extra as replacement, flashes
      burn quick) in CDC Medical for EMTs, in their locker room
  - rscadd: Modified content of armoury, there are less rifles now (except in HCZ
      which still has 8 assault rifles to arm 8 out of 9 operatives). HCZ has a new
      LMG, the M60, but there is only one of them. All zone armouries have variants
      of sidearms as well as Saiga12 with variants of shell boxes and mags (in both
      non lethal and lethal). HCZ now has frag grenades and a single grenade launcher
      (not to be abused). HCZ is truly the heavy weapon guys of the Site now
  - rscadd: 'New shotgun shell: Rubbershot. It''s basically buckshot but non lethal
      (it is to buckshot what beanbag is to slug)'
  - rscadd: Connected Reeducation room through a tunnel to inside of CDCZ. It's relatively
      secluded now, but its as expected for a room where the unspeakable occur.
