  EgorDinamit:
  - tweak: SCP-049 now cures people by upgrading its grab far enough.
  - tweak: SCP-049 may breach if left alone for too long. Make sure it has someone
      to talk to!
  - tweak: SCP-049 will receive temporary speed buff when attacked. Avoid fast weapons!
  cheesePizza2:
  - tweak: Slightly shrunk 2427's containment chamber.
  - rscadd: Added a button in the lower right of the UI that shows facing direction.
      Clicking the button allows you to quickly face a direction (same as if you used
      the verb).
  - imageadd: Cleaned up icon folder.
  - balance: RAISA Agent has higher security access, matching Senior EZ Agents.
  - bugfix: RAISA Agent can't be an antagonist anymore.
  cheesePizza2, checkraisefold:
  - rscadd: Ordered lists were added to pencode. Check the codex for more info.
  - rscadd: A new database was added to the server room - the Paperwork Database.
      Quickly download useful forms from the (relative) safety of your laptop! Office
      workers, consider sending the IT Tech new forms to add to the download list.
  - rscadd: ACS is here! SCP articles now have a special ACS bar that displays info.
      Check the Pencode codex entry for details on usage.
  - bugfix: SCP articles actually use pencode now - you can edit them without breaking
      them.
  - bugfix: Downloaded files are now *copies* of the server's file, not actual references
      to their file. Whoops!
  - code_imp: Paper uses /datum/browser, allowing for compatibility with newer Internet
      Explorer versions.
