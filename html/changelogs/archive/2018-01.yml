  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Cryobags, cryo and general stasis changes. Main point is that stasis is
      no longer binary on/off, it doesn't stop life ticking, just slows it down (usually
      a lot). It chemical processing is slowed down too, so sometimes bigger stasis
      is not better.
  - tweak: Cryo. Being very cold now provides stasis on its own - and cryo is easiest
      way of doing it. At 80K, it applies 20x stasis factor (life ticks once in 40
      seconds instead once in 2).
  - tweak: Cryo chemless healing was slowed down a bit. It also no longer magically
      multiplies chems in beakers by 10x. Cryox/clonex adjusted to work at same efficiency
      with this change.
  - tweak: Cold damage in cryo is now prevented by clonex or cryox, not cryopod itself.
      On one hand you now NEED to have it in beaker if you care about patient, on
      another - you don't need cryopod if you have those and sufficiently cold place.
  - tweak: Cryobags. Cryobags no longer last forever. Their power drops every 5 minutes
      - examine to see current. It starts at 20x and loses 25% every time, so 20x
      to 15x to 11x in 10 minutes and so on. Will drop into nothingness at ~40 minutes
      mark.
  - rscadd: Stasis will make you drowsy, and at higher stasis settings you will fall
      asleep eventually (15x or higher).

      5x.'

      the ability to cut-off certain sections of the hallways for flow control.
  - maptweak: Brig officer now has a disposals bin.
  - maptweak: Emergency armory has been altered to have 3 carbines and 3 e-guns as

2018-05-16:
  Banditoz:
  - maptweak: Remaps the Petrov toxins lab to be more intuitive to use.
  - tweak: Powered crossbows have been buffed. You don't need to draw back as much,
      and it takes less time to do so.
2018-05-17:
  afterthought2:
  - tweak: The deck management program will now allow you to queue up scheduled missions,
      rearrange their order, and delete them. Once started (i.e. once the shuttle
      departs) the active mission is finalized and can no longer be deleted or moved
      around, but can still be renamed.

      no longer spawn with ranks in uniform if selecting off-duty.
  chaoko99:
  - tweak: Books and papers may now be 2x as long. This was changed to make it so
      records could be longer, without the skeleton taking up half the usable text.
2018-06-07:
  Cajoes:
  - rscadd: Added new visors for Tajaran to shield their eyes with. Available exclusively
      in the xeno portion of the loadout screen.

  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added methyl bromide, a fumigant gas that kills spiders.
  - rscadd: Added bromide, a toxic reagent, from which can be derived a liquid form
      of methyl bromide. Methyl bromide kills spiderlings and egg sacs when injected.
  - rscadd: Added algae to hydroponics. Algae produce liquid bromide and gaseous methyl
      bromide.
  - rscadd: Added an interaction to optables that will automatically put someone lying
      on top of it to sleep with no need for N2O or painkillers.
  - rscdel: Removed N2O pumps as being both redundant and buggy.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: The slowdown for pulling (i.e. ctl-click) stuff is now affected by the
      "Athletics" skill.
  - tweak: Bigger/stronger species pull things faster.
  - rscadd: Pulling stuff generates adrenaline, depending on "Athletics" skill. This
      may raise your heart rate. Pulling for a long time without breaks with low skill
      may give you the jitter effect and minor heart damage (won't kill you).
2018-06-09:
  Banditoz:
  - tweak: The T-Ray scanner is now faster, has an increased range of 7x7, and is
      now without the flicker effect.

2018-06-11:
  BlueNexus:
  - tweak: Increased TC costs for railguns
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Now for ghetto EVA the size of thrown thing matters. Tiny things give you
      ~10% chance of direction change, with 'normal' sized things having 90%, guartanteed
      above.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Throwing "huge" items (e.g. roller beds, backpacks, certain guns, rigs,
      jetpacks) or normal sized mobs without "Basic" skill in "Athletics" will briefly
      weaken you (and the items won't go far).
  - rscadd: Thrown items don't go as far and have less speed/force if you have lower
      "Athletics" skill.
  - rscadd: The weightlifting machine at the gym has more weight levels. Having high
      "Athletics" means you can lift more. If you try lifting way more than you are
      capable of, you may hurt yourself.
  sabiram and Cakey:
  - rscadd: The bird temple on the mining map has been redesigned and now houses the
      fountain of youth.
2018-06-12:
  Broseph Stylin:
  - rscadd: Added rucksacks to Character Setup. They function exactly the same as
      backpacks.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Lactate is a reagent that increases heart rate, causes generally harmless
      shortness of breath, and slows movement. After processing a large amount of
      lactate, mobs may experience temporary jitters.
  - tweak: Instead of producing adrenaline, pulling produces lactate.
  - rscadd: Robots can now interact with storage items like boxes and bags.
  chaoko99:
  - bugfix: Trays will now adequately notify you of not being able to be placed in
      bags.

  - maptweak: The Torch has been modified to use window frames instead of just windows.
  - maptweak: Maintenance has been given more catwalks.
  - maptweak: Added binoculars to security checkpoints.
  ZeroBits:
  - tweak: Material Grinders have been reworked to allow different reagent quantities
      and multiple reagents when grinding material sheets
  Zuhayr:
  - tweak: Gas inhalation effects are now reagent-based. Gases create reagents inside
      the body, which then apply effects. This means that gaseous phoron exposure,
      for example, needs to be treated with dialysis/dylovene, as it fills your guts
      up with liquid phoron.
  - tweak: The poison_type var on species datums is now poison_types, and determines
      which poison gasses show you the toxins UI indicator, rather than which ones
      cause poisoning. The actual effects of poisonous gasses is determined by the
      reagent value (as per dexalin being injected into a vox, etc.). This really
      shouldn't impact anything for the average player, except that chlorine and nitrogen
      dioxide (not N2O, for clarity) are now actually poisonous.
  - tweak: Helium now makes your voice squeaky. Very important feature.
  - tweak: Xenon is now functionally the same as N2O, including the following note.
  - tweak: N2O now causes giggling, confusion, dizziness and occasional passing out
      at high dosages, rather than instant and immediate knockout. Still useful for
      riot control and now flooding it into distro isn't a round-ender. You might
      even be able to use it without admins shouting at you! Refer to the optable
      neural suppressor PR for a replacement method to sedate people for surgery.
  - tweak: Finally, as a sidenote, Bogani will actually be poisoned by oxygen and
      chlorine will have a visible overlay now.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Experienced in Chemistry allows you to see scannable reagents in a held
      beaker/container.
  - rscadd: Professional in Chemistry allows you to see all reagents in a held container.
  - tweak: Science goggles give more precise volume readings at higher chem skill.
2018-06-14:
  ElRobusto:
  - tweak: Cuts the Vox space suit movement penalty by half.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds two currently admin-only races, the Starborn and the Blueforged.

  - tweak: Grayson, W-T Economy, and Xion are now available at the roboticist fabricator.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: The chem grinder is dangerous to use at "Unskilled" in Chemistry and will
      lose some ingredients depending on skill level.
  - rscadd: The chem dispenser will give inaccurate amounts of ingredients or add
      extra contaminating ingredients when below skill "Trained" (in Chemistry or
      Cooking, depending on dispenser)  Can be slightly dangerous.
  - rscadd: The chem master now has two modes. "Quick" will move the correct amount
      of ingredients from beaker to buffer, but also add contaminants (depending on
      skill). "Thorough" will only move the desired ingredient, but incur losses (depending
      on skill). Skill checked is Chemistry for chem master, Cooking for Condimaster.
  - rscadd: Moving ingredients from buffer to waste or beaker acts like on "Quick"
      mode.
2018-06-17:
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Adds bowman type headsets to all non-service departments.
  - rscadd: Adds unique pilot, miner, corpsman, and explorer headsets.
  - rscadd: Adds tacticool Syndicate headsets to mercs.
  - rscadd: If tcomms is down or unavailable for whatever reason and you have a shortwave
      radio in your pocket, your headset will now automatically transmit through it.
      It still cannot do department channels.
2018-06-18:
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Some loadout items are now restricted by branch instead of jobs. Some are
      restricted by both. You might experience sudden loss of swag on next spawn,
      check your setup.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds various starlight specific spells for use in future deity form.
  - tweak: Adds two new flags for targeted spells to filter via faction.
  - tweak: Adds more effects for some spells.

      skill X can instruct a character in X from Untrained to Basic. Has a 15 minute
      cooldown to use; buff lasts all round; max of three buffs on any person. The
      target has to be close and there's a short timer during which neither party
      should move.
  chaoko99:
  - rscadd: Adds a fully reusable backstabbing mechanic, used by butterfly knives
      and switchblades.
2018-06-19:
  Kurgis:
  - tweak: Changed the brain loss Impedrezine inflicts to allow it to kill a person.
  Miraviel:
  - rscdel: 'Removed the time restriction on the following jobs: Explorer, Corpsman,
      Deck Technician, and Scientist.'
  - maptweak: Reorganized the kitchen cabinet and the crates in the Medical Storage
      (the big bag of salt and the defibrillator are no longer blocking everything
      else).
  - maptweak: Removed the anaesthetics closet from the Medical Storage.
  comma:
  - tweak: XO now gets a box of spare headset keys instead of box of XO headsets
  - rscadd: Bowman headsets can hold 3 keys instead of 2
  - rscadd: BO Bowman headsets hold 4 keys
2018-06-20:

      sniper type role.
  - balance: All railguns now suffer a substantial penalty when fired one-handed.
  - balance: The basic railgun projectile no longer stuns, and does less damage.

      projectile.
  - balance: The TCC railgun's (available in the traitor menu) ammo capacity has been
      reduced from 10 to 6.
  - balance: Substantially increased firing delay on all semi-automatic coilguns and
      railguns.
  - balance: Holding or stowing a railgun now slows you down more.

      lesser with skill, no slipping at experienced.
  - rscadd: Flooring when entering gravity from space is now not guaranteed at Basic
      skill or more. Doesn't happen at Professional skill.
  - rscadd: At Unskilled and Basic skill, jetpack can sometimes go wrong way. Not
      that bad if you notice in time and have fuel to turn back.
  - rscadd: At Professional skill you go faster when in space with a jetpack. Zooom.
  - tweak: Skills now affect surgery. Trained or Experienced (depending on what you're
      trying to do) skill is needed to ensure step won't fail. Professional skill
      will offset various penalties (not proper optable, improvised tools etc) a bit.
      Time of step is affected by Anatomy skill too.
  - tweak: Some other skills help with some steps, e.g. Trained Forensics offsets
      penalty for incisions, and Complex Devices skill is used instead for robotic
      organ steps, with Electrician and Construction helping with simple limb repair
      steps.
  Chisnky:
  - experiment: Melee weapons now have different attack cooldowns, generally with
      smaller weapons being faster, bigger slower. Normal sized weapons are baseline,
      having same attack cooldown as they did.
  - experiment: Material weapons further tweak their attack cooldown based on material
      used.
  afterthought2:
  - rscdel: The leadership skill has been removed. Check your characters' skill allocations.

  - rscadd: Optimization pass on Geiger counters, and a few effect systems (Smoke
      and sparks)
  - rscadd: Underwear may now go into washing machines. Still can't be bloodied, but
      at least you can do that now. For you weird people who roleplay showering!
  - tweak: Rags may now clean more than just blood. More importantly, they show their
      progress bar when cleaning.
2018-06-21:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Close Combat now has ingame effects. Mostly chances to hit in melee.
  - rscadd: Disarm chances now both affected by skills and anything tha affects melee

      locked away behind Trained skill in CQC.

      catwalks.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Botany skill now has ingame effects.
  - rscadd: Without at least basic skill, you can screw up when planting or weeding
      trays. You'll also be unable to recognize pests and weeds from useful things.
  - rscadd: Exotic seeds (all random variations) need trained skill to avoid screw
      ups like that.
  - rscadd: Trained skill is also needed to handle xenobotany machines, otherwise
      you'll be prone to wasting your samples really fast.
  - rscadd: Experienced and professional levels of skill reduce degradation of samples
      in xenobotany machines.
  - experiment: Constantly fixing brain is no longer the pro strat anymore.
  - rscadd: When fixing very damaged (broken level or more) organs in surgery, their
      max health is lowered.
  - rscadd: Brains get their health lowered /always/ if oxygenation is below survival
      level (30%). Better fix cause of damage first, if you don't want to do permanent
      damage.
  - rscadd: Forensic skils now have ingame effects. Without at least basic skill,
      you leave slightly more fingerprints on things, and you will leave prints when
      trying to evidence bag things.
  - rscdel: You need Trained skill to use evidence collection things and forensic
      machines. At higher skill you work microscope faster.
  - rscadd: Offstation antags (and traider) can now become ALIUMS!
  - rscadd: Their bases have 'alien monolith' somewhere, which turns you into a humanoid
      alien of unknown species.
  - rscadd: Remember to implant the spawned translator implanter if you're planning
      on talking to people.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Having Basic finance gives the Appraise verb, which allows you to estimate
      the value of items you are holding or have equipped (found in the IC tab). Higher
      skill levels give more accurate assessments.
  - tweak: The financial skill has a large effect on your starting cash.
  - tweak: Higher financial skill gives you better deals from traders.
  - rscadd: Using virology machines without sufficient virology skill may get you
      or your friends infected. For curing purposes, "Trained" negates this effect,
      but for doing splicing and mutations, "Experienced" or "Professional" may be
      needed.
  - rscadd: The printout from the virus analyzer may have missing or erroneous information
      if you lack "Experienced" in virology. Quality of information improves with
      skill.
2018-06-23:

      you might place it on the wrong wire, and then have a hard time removing it.
  - rscadd: A new "Examine" option has been added to the hacking menu. Below experienced
      it doesn't do much. On experienced one or two wires will be identifiable on
      examine, while at master most will be. Less effective for "secure" objects with
      randomized wiring.

      Left 4 Zed or Robust Harvest) with welder fuel to make it. Add aluminium for
      more oomph if you can get it.

      are no longer likely to remove the light tube when turning the lights on.
  - maptweak: Deck 1 - Xenoflora and Miscellaneous labs are now brighter. This should
      allow for scientists to actually see the things they work on. Robotics now has
      solid doors. Privacy windows are no longer thwarted by looking through the door-windows.
      Added a window to the mech bay side to compensate for the lack of visibility
      from that direction due to the door no longer having a window. Door to storage
      next to robotics actually opens for the roboticist now. Removed power cable

      need to actually face the direction they were mapped in.

      still be generated, with faked entries for the download info.'
  - rscadd: The antag access decryption program is more effective at higher skill

      science skill will reveal additional information about them.
  - rscadd: By heating them to almost, but not quite, their boiling points, the effects
      of these chemicals strengthen (if with phoron catalysis, then weaken). By also
      adding certain additional ingredients (depending on the effect), the effect
      will instead be left unchanged.
  - rscadd: 'Cooling works similarly, but now the default behavior is that the effect
      is left unchanged: you need to add certain additional ingredients to make the
      effect strengthen (or weaken, with phoron).'

      effects that can be used, or (if purified sufficiently) can be sold for large
