      the cigarettes on your desk.
  - tweak: Added two canes to the medical storage, for people who have leg injuries
      and can't walk good and stuff. I do not want to see doctors pretending to be

      the cigarettes on your desk.
  - tweak: Added two canes to the medical storage, for people who have leg injuries
      and can't walk good and stuff. I do not want to see doctors pretending to be
