  - rscadd: You may now become addicted to certain drugs if you've been taking them
      for long enough. Becoming addicted is done by gaining addiction points from

      addicted by lowering your addiction points until it reaches a low enough value(i.e.
      by not taking drugs). Most addictions will have withdraval effects, however.
