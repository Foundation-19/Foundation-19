changes:
  - rscadd: Barsign description changes based on icon. Add some flair to your restaurant!
  - bugfix: Bartender and Cook now actually have Bar, Kitchen, and Hydroponics access

      by request of Tsuru
  - imageadd: Some TG icons were ported for the barsign, as well as new SCP-themed
      signs.
  - refactor: SCP-078 code works better now, although it still has no in-game effect.
